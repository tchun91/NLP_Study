Week 1 - Neural Network Basic Foundation.
1. Classification/regression model
2. Use pytorch / pure python(extra credit)
3. Use two layers including activation functions at least (linear layer, relu etcâ€¦)
4. Have a good understanding of backward and forward propagation process during the training and have a short summary.
5. Have a mathematical summary (model structure) of your own model
6. Have a base model as a benchmark ex) logistic/regression model
7. Add regularization techniques in your loss function on your base and nn model such as L1 and L2 and explain why you used it.
8. Have your github page shown these results in a notebook.(math expression in github as well)
