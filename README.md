NLP_Study
Week 1 - Neural Network Basic Foundation.
1. Classification/regression model
2. Use pytorch / pure python(extra credit)
3. Use two layers including activation functions at least (linear layer, relu etcâ€¦)
4. Have a good understanding of backward and forward propagation process during the training and have a short summary.
5. Have a mathematical summary (model structure) of your own model
6. Have a base model as a benchmark ex) logistic/regression model
7. Add regularization techniques in your loss function on your base and nn model such as L1 and L2 and explain why you used it.
8. Have your github page shown these results in a notebook.(math expression in github as well)

Week 2 - NLP Basic Foundation
1. NLP basic components - lemmatization, token, stopwords, ngram, tfidf, tokenizer, and etc
- Summarize definition
2. Sentiment analysis - dictionary look for an open source definition and apply to the given data in your own perspective.
3. Word cloud - What are the most common words? What would be removed and what would be the result after removing?
4. Bigram, trigram Analysis - Same as 2 and 3
5. Use Tf-idf or bag of words and have your corpus.
- Summarize definition
6. Using the result from #5, predict category or section of each article. Share the result and metrics. (You can use any classification model.)
