    "## NLP Components\n",
    "1. Lemmatization: Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form to normalize them across different forms. \n",
    "- Example: The lemma of the word \"running\" is \"run\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Token: A token is a single unit of text obtained after splitting a sentence or document based on certain criteria, such as whitespace or punctuation.\n",
    "- Example: In the sentence \"I love programming\", the tokens are \"I\", \"love\", and \"programming\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form by removing suffixes, which allows different variations of the same word to be treated as the same word.\n",
    "- Example: The stem of the words \"running\", \"runs\", and \"runner\" is \"run\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stopwords: Stopwords are common words that are often filtered out during text processing because they typically do not carry significant meaning.\n",
    "- Example: In English, stopwords can include words like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. N-gram: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items (words or characters) in a sentence or document.\n",
    "- Example: In the sentence \"The quick brown fox\", examples of n-grams are unigrams (\"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\"), bigrams (\"The quick\", \"quick brown\", \"brown fox\"), and trigrams (\"The quick brown\", \"quick brown fox\").\n",
    "\n",
    "6. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.\n",
    "- Example: In a document containing multiple sentences, the TF-IDF score of a word is higher if it appears frequently in that document but rarely in other documents in the collection.\n",
    "* $ W_{x,y} = {tf}_{x,y} * \\log({N \\over df_x} ) $\n",
    "* tf = frequency of x in y\n",
    "* df = number of documents containing x\n",
    "* N = total number of documents\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Tokenizer: A tokenizer is a tool used to break down a text into smaller units, such as words, phrases, or sentences, based on specific rules.\n",
    "- Example: The NLTK library in Python provides various tokenizers, such as word tokenizers and sentence tokenizers, which can be used to tokenize text data.\n",

They don\\'t explain that to us. \"You have to try to play the ball and Eric didn\\'t want to play the ball but it escaped his control. He tried to cut it off like any defender would.\"García, meanwhile, told RTVE: \"The referee said I had the intention to play the ball, he said I should have stepped aside and let Mbappé control it, which is the rule. \"I think that\\'s what hurts the most -- a defender will never in their life step aside [in that instance]. Hopefully, they change that.\"READ: With some \\'more open to conspiracy theories,\\' vaccination rates of English Premier League players remain shrouded in mysteryGarcía (center) competes for the ball with Mbappé during the Nations League final. France, which narrowly missed out on getting the game\\'s first goal when Theo Hernández hit the bar, held on for the victory after two excellent saves from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in the game\\'s final moments.It was the second time in two games that France had come from behind to win following a thrilling comeback against Belgium in the semifinals. \"I\\'m extremely proud, I\\'m very happy for the players,\" manager Didier Deschamps told UEFA of the victory.\"It\\'s true that we were in two difficult situations in these two matches ... quite apart from the quality and the talent in this team, we also have this mentality and team spirit.\" France\\'s Nations League triumph comes after Portugal became the first country to win the tournament in 2019.

       " 'Giulio Regeni murder: Four Egyptian officers face Italian trial  - CNN The trial of four senior members of Egypt\\'s security services started on Thursday in their absence, with the quartet facing charges over their alleged role in the disappearance and murder of student Giulio Regeni in Cairo in 2016. europe, Giulio Regeni murder: Four Egyptian officers face Italian trial  - CNN Four Egyptian officers stand trial in Italy over Regeni murder RomeThe trial of four senior members of Egypt\\'s security services started on Thursday in their absence, with the quartet facing charges over their alleged role in the disappearance and murder of student Giulio Regeni in Cairo in 2016.Italy hopes the trial will shed light on a killing that shocked the country and strained ties with Egypt, which has repeatedly denied that its officials had anything to do with Regeni\\'s brutal death.\"The search for the truth has always been, and will continue to be, a fundamental goal in our relations with Egypt,\" Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the case last month.\"Achieving a definitive picture, in the framework of a fair trial, will not bring Giulio back to his parents, but it will reaffirm the strength of justice, transparency and the rule of law in which he believed.\"A postgraduate student at Britain\\'s Cambridge University, Regeni disappeared in the Egyptian capital in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post-mortem examination showed he had been extensively tortured before his death.Read MoreItalian and Egyptian prosecutors investigated the case together, but the two sides later fell out and came to very different conclusions.The Italian prosecutors say Major Magdi Sharif, from Egypt\\'s General Intelligence, Major General Tarek Sabir, the former head of state security, police Colonel Hisham Helmy and Colonel Ather Kamal, a former head of investigations in Cairo city, were responsible for the \"aggravated kidnapping\" of Regeni.Sharif has also been accused of \"conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.\"The suspects have never responded publicly to the accusations and Egyptian police and officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni\\'s disappearance and killing.Wronged partyRegeni\\'s parents were amongst the first to arrive at the trial, which is being held in a high-security Rome prison.Prime Minister Mario Draghi\\'s office said the government would be a civil party in the case, indicating that it sees itself as a wronged party.Court-appointed defense lawyers say the trial should not be held because it is not certain that any of the suspects know about the proceedings.A judge overruled their objection at a preliminary hearing in May, saying news of the investigation would have reached them regardless. However, the trial judge could on Thursday decide otherwise and demand another effort is made to contact them.Regeni had been in Cairo to research Egypt\\'s independent unions for his doctoral thesis. Associates say he was also interested in the long-standing domination of Egypt\\'s economy by the state and military. Both subjects are sensitive in Egypt.Prosecutors say they have evidence showing that Sharif got informants to follow Regeni and eventually had him arrested in a Cairo metro station. The charge sheet says Sharif, and other, unidentified Egyptian officials, then tortured Regeni over several days, causing him \"acute physical suffering.\"Egyptian authorities initially said Regeni died in a road accident. They later said he was the victim of a kidnapping by gangsters who were subsequently caught and killed by police.It is not clear how long the trial will last. The government has said it will seek to extradite anyone convicted in the case.',\n",
       " 'German officials say AstraZeneca vaccine shouldn\\'t be given to over-65s, citing lack of data - CNN Germany\\'s vaccine commission said the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine should not be given to people older than 65 years, amid a bitter dispute between the European Union and the drugmaker over delayed supplies. europe, German officials say AstraZeneca vaccine shouldn\\'t be given to over-65s, citing lack of data - CNN German officials say AstraZeneca vaccine shouldn\\'t be given to over-65s, citing lack of data Berlin (CNN)Germany\\'s vaccine commission said the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine should not be given to people older than 65 years, amid a bitter dispute between the European Union and the drugmaker over delayed supplies.The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) at Germany\\'s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the country\\'s main public health authority, found there is insufficient data on the effectiveness of the vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, for this age group, according to a statement from the interior ministry on Thursday. \"Due to the small number of study participants in the age group ≥65 years, no conclusion can be made regarding efficacy and safety in the elderly. This vaccine is therefore currently recommended by STIKO only for persons aged 18-64 years,\" the panel said in its recommendation.Responding to the announcement, an AstraZeneca spokesperson said \"latest analyses of clinical trial data for the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine support efficacy in the over 65 years age group.\" The drugmaker is awaiting a regulatory decision by the European Union medicines regulator, the spokesperson added. Thursday\\'s announcement by the German Interior Ministry came amid an ongoing dispute between the European Union and AstraZeneca over delays to the delivery of its coronavirus vaccine to the bloc.Europe has a vaccine shortage. So why is it fighting with AstraZeneca? Read MoreAstraZeneca has said it can\\'t deliver as many doses as the EU expected, citing production challenges. But the European Commission, which ordered the vaccine on behalf of EU member states, says this is unacceptable, and the drugmaker must find a way to increase supply.The dispute comes as EU countries, including Germany, run low on vaccines, In Spain, the regional government of Madrid has paused administering first doses of the vaccine, to ensure there is enough to provide second doses for those who already got their first shots. Concerns over expected shortages of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines means some French regions, including Paris, will push back or cancel appointments for first injections, the French health Ministry said in a press statement on Thursday.EfficacyThe United Kingdom, whose regulator approved the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine nearly a month ago, has been administering doses to people older than 65.In its report, UK regulator MHRA, said there was \"limited information available on efficacy in participants aged 65 or over, although there is nothing to suggest lack of protection.\"Responding the German announcement, MHRA Chief Executive Dr. June Raine said \"current evidence does not suggest any lack of protection against Covid-19 in people aged 65 or over.\"\"The data we have shows that the vaccine produces a strong immune response in the over-65s. More data is continually becoming available for this age group and our Public Assessment Report, available on our website, will be updated to reflect this,\" her statement added.The EU has ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which could be approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as soon as Friday -- with an option to purchase an additional 100 million doses.AstraZeneca\\'s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in an interview with Italy\\'s la Repubblica newspaper Tuesday that \"the issue with the elderly data is not so much whether it works or not. It\\'s that we have today a limited amount of data in the older population.\"Soriot said this was because the Oxford scientists running the vaccine trials did not want to recruit older people until they had \"accumulated a lot of safety data\" for those aged 18 to 55.\"Essentially, because Oxford started vaccinating older people later, we don\\'t have a huge number of older people who have been vaccinated. So that\\'s what the debate is,\" he said. \"But we have strong data showing very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, similar to what we see in younger people. It\\'s possible that some countries, out of caution, will use our vaccine for the younger group.\"A member of medical staff draws up the AstraZeneca/Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine at the NHS Nightingale North East hospital on January 26, 2021 in Sunderland, England.Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stressed that the German decision was \"not a regulatory decision, but draft advice on usage\" in comments to the UK\\'s Science Media Centre.It was \"well known that the clinical data for this vaccine were limited for those aged 70 and over,\" he said, because AstraZeneca recruited older age groups later than younger age groups, allowing less time for cases to accrue.\"There is no reason at all for anyone in the UK or elsewhere to think that this Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is ineffective at any age,\" Evans said. \"Its ability to be delivered to people in GP surgeries and care homes makes it a vital component in the attempts to reduce hospitalisation and deaths, especially in the elderly.\" Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute and professor of structural biology at the University of Oxford, also sought to allay concerns, noting that German scientists had concluded that the vaccine was safe and effective for under-65s.\"Their assessment is that effectiveness is not yet demonstrated for over 65s. They have not said the vaccine is ineffective for over 65s,\" he told the Science Media Centre.  \"Good faith discussions about what evidence is needed for vaccine effectiveness are really important. Experimental evidence and reasoned debate, not over heated rhetoric, will resolve this issue.\"EU-AstraZeneca disputeEU and AstraZeneca fight over vaccine delays while death toll mountsAs the dispute between the EU and AstraZeneca over vaccine delays rumbled on, Belgian health authorities -- at the request of the European Commission -- conducted \"an inspection\" of the UK-Swedish drugmaker\\'s Belgian production facility Wednesday. The purpose was \"to ensure that the delay in the delivery of the vaccines is indeed due to a production problem at the Belgian site,\" France Dammel, a spokeswoman for Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke, said in a statement.\"Belgian experts are looking into the elements obtained during this inspection visit, together with Dutch, Italian and Spanish experts,\" Dammel said, adding that the report is expected in a few days.The German government expects the country to face shortages in its supply of the coronavirus vaccine for at least another 10 weeks, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday amid backlash over the pace of the government\\'s vaccine rollout program.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus infections per 100,000 residents across seven days in Germany has fallen below the critical threshold of 100 for the first time in three months, to 98, the RKI said Thursday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has outlined the government\\'s plan to reduce the incidence rate to less than 50 new infections per 100,000 residents within seven days in order to be able to track and trace infections.

Yet this quarter-century-later \"requel\" (a term specifically explained in the movie) turns out to be a great deal of fun, cleverly wedding familiar faces with new stars in what isn\\'t exactly a remake or reboot but rather plays like a refresh.Horror has been one of the more reliable subgenres during the pandemic, but the current Omicron wave has complicated the calculus. Still, wherever people wind up seeing this designed-to-please slasher movie -- even if that\\'s minus a crowd -- it should possess a healthy shelf life.Half the battle was won, in hindsight, during the casting, tapping Melissa Barrera (\"In the Heights\"), Jenna Ortega (\"Stuck in the Middle\") and Jack Quaid (\"The Boys\") for key roles among the younger contingent, while bringing back Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette in their original roles.The trick comes in replicating elements of the original by the late director Wes Craven (to whom the movie\\'s dedicated) and writer Kevin Williamson -- a horror flick that actually runs down the rules for surviving a horror flick, then watches the characters break them anyway -- updating that by overlaying the new on the old.All that\\'s achieved, fairly impressively, while simultaneously lampooning the original, its three sequels and that 25-year relationship with the audience, but still treating it with a level of every-detail-counts earnestness generally reserved for movies with superheroes or spaceships. Plus, there are plenty of references to recent horror movies, their varying levels of ambition and where \"Scream\" fits in.Read MoreIt spoils nothing to say the basic template remains intact, with an incident involving Ortega\\'s character bringing her older sister (Barrera) back to the town of Woodsboro, accompanied by her boyfriend (Quaid). An earlier killing spree there prompted a series of movies, meaning this Ghostface killer is tapping into that mythology, leaving no shortage of suspects or bodies.The newbies get the bright idea of seeking out advice from old pros, which is where Arquette, Cox and Campbell come into the picture, however grudgingly.Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett deliver the requisite gore by the bucket, never letting an open door -- closet, refrigerator, you name it -- go unexploited in terms of trying to milk a jump or scare out of it.As noted, venerable horror franchises like \"Halloween\" have managed to lure people to theaters during this challenging time, bucking the overall trend.That might not rate high in the rules for surviving a pandemic, but it bodes pretty well for \"Scream\" proving successful enough to rise again, whether that\\'s a sequel, remake, reboot, or as in this case, essentially all of the above.\"Scream\" premieres in US theaters on Jan. 14. It\\'s rated R.',\n",

A sperm shortage could slow things down\\nFrance has legalized fertility treatments for lesbian and single women. But a sperm shortage could slow things down. \\n - CNN France has legalized fertility treatments for lesbian and single women. A sperm shortage may slow things down Paris (CNN)Aurore Foursy describes her first date with Julie Ligot as one of the longest in history. After matching on Tinder, they met up at Julie\\'s apartment on Friday night and stayed together until Monday. The chemistry was instant. Foursy was a lifelong LGBT activist. Ligot worked in IT. They were both in their 30s and wanted children. They soon moved in together, cleared a second room in their apartment and bought a crib. \"It was logical for us to build a family together,\" said Foursy.  Thanks to a decree signed by the French health minister on Wednesday, their dream could finally come true. A law passed in June, legalizing fertility treatments for lesbian couples and single women, has now come into effect. \"It is a huge step for France,\" said Foursy. \"We\\'ve been fighting so long for this right.\"Aurore Foursy and Julie Ligot always knew they wanted to start a family together.France is now among a total of 13 countries in Europe -- 11 EU member states as well as the UK and Iceland -- offering fertility treatment to both lesbian and single women. Fertility clinics expect a surge of demand. Read More\"We are expecting an extra 200 patients per year,\" said Laurence Pavie, who works as a manager at the Diaconesses Croix Saint-Simon fertility center in Paris. \"The world needs to know that lesbian couples and single women are most welcome. We will try to give them the best treatment possible,\" she said. Earlier this month, the Health Ministry announced an extra $9.3 million in spending on staffing and equipment for fertility clinics, to help them cope with the anticipated surge in demand. It aims to reduce the waiting time for treatment from one year, the current average, to six months. A sperm donation crisisFor Dr. Meryl Toledano, who runs her own fertility clinic, this target seems ambitious. \"With French sperm alone, we will struggle to meet the demand,\" she said. France does not allow the importation of sperm from overseas. And because the law forbids sperm donation for money, France also struggles to produce enough of its own. The new legislation also includes an end to guaranteed anonymity for sperm donors from September 2022, a move likely to add to the shortage.The most recent official figures show that a total of just 317 sperm donations were made in France in 2019 -- down from 386 in 2018, and 404 the year before. The Agency of Biomedicine, a state-funded body, plans to launch an online information campaign on October 20 in a bid to address the sperm crisis.\"Donating sperm is an intimate action of solidarity,\" said Helene Duguet, a spokesperson for the agency. \"The first step is to inform people that these donations are possible and can help people to form families. The idea is to encourage donors for years to come.\"The long waiting times driven by the sperm shortage mean that many older lesbian and single women plan to continue going for fertility treatment overseas -- despite the new law. Toledano often recommends that older women take this step. \"In Spain you can get sperm in one day, so patients with money go there. Those who don\\'t have money have to wait 6 to 12 months and risk being unsuccessful because at the age of 40, this has an enormous effect on the probability of pregnancy,\" she said.A traumatizing journeyNow 38, Marie conceived a child through IVF in Belgium back in 2015 -- back when it was still illegal for her, as a lesbian, to receive such treatment in France. \"It was annoying. I pay taxes in France and am proud to pay taxes and am happy that they could help others. But I would have been happy if I could have benefited too [from fertility treatment],\" said Marie, who requested that CNN not use her surname to protect the privacy of her child. After five years of failed attempts, heartbreak and more than $52,000 in medical fees and travel expenses alone, she was finally rewarded with the birth of her first child, Louise. \"My first fertility treatment course was a real trauma,\" she said. \"I was frustrated that it wasn\\'t working. I hated that others had so many unwanted or unplanned pregnancies. I grew bitter. I hated people. I became someone I didn\\'t want to be.\"Aurore Foursy feels the long fight for equal access to facility treatment has now been won.In hope of having a second child, Marie has now gone to Spain with her new partner -- in part because she is scared of languishing on a waiting list in France. \"I won\\'t put in the same time, energy or money. I already have a daughter and I don\\'t want her not to go on holidays because we are trying to give her a little brother or sister -- and also because I am not the same age as I was back then,\" she said.China says it\\'s restricting abortions to promote gender equality. Experts are skepticalAs well as the new rules around insemination, the legislation also allows women in their 30s to freeze their eggs, a procedure previously only available to those undergoing medical treatment likely to impact fertility. Surrogacy, however, remains illegal, leaving gay men, as well as women who cannot carry a pregnancy, to seek other options or travel abroad.But for many, the new law has provided a glimmer of hope. \"The fight is over,\" said Foursy. \"Everybody has the same rights. Every type of woman has the same rights and I can choose to be a mother or not by myself.\"',\n",

       " 'Rainbow-colored fly species named after RuPaul  - CNN Australian entomologists announced they have named a fly species after RuPaul -- the titan of drag queens. australia, Rainbow-colored fly species named after RuPaul  - CNN RuPaul has a new namesake -- and it\\'s a fabulous, rainbow-colored fly  (CNN)Drag culture\\'s far-reaching influence on society was affirmed on Wednesday, when Australian entomologists announced they have named a fly species after RuPaul -- the titan of drag queens.The soldier fly, whose Latin name is Opaluma rupaul, is adorned with bold rainbow colors and is bound to catch the attention of anyone that comes across it -- much like the drag icon herself. Bryan Lessard -- also known as \"Bry the Fly Guy\" in scientific circles -- of  Australia\\'s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), is responsible for naming the species and he says there were myriad reasons why he chose the moniker.\\'RuPaul\\'s Drag Race\\' welcoming first trans man contestant \"I\\'d been watching a lot of \\'RuPaul\\'s Drag Race\\' when I was examining the specimen under the microscope, so it was on my mind!\" Lessard told CNN. \"And I really wanted to give this group of flies a memorable name because it needs the attention -- the first specimen of this RuPaul fly was collected over a hundred years ago and sat neglected in a museum collection until someone with the knowledge of that group came along to name and document them.\"Many of the 13 new soldier flies Lessard named are from areas affected by Australia\\'s devastating 2019-2020 bushfires -- which is part of the reason he wanted to give at least one of them a name no one would forget. Read More\"These species would have burnt and no one would have cared if I hadn\\'t given them a name,\" Lessard said.Opaluma rupaul is characterized by its iridescent colors.The RuPaul fly is just one of 150 new species to be named by CSIRO recently -- and it isn\\'t the only one to be named after a pop culture figure.The organization has also named three newly discovered, rare beetles after characters from Pokémon -- the Japanese anime series that spawned an entire franchise of video games, toys and trading cards. The beetles are named Binburrum articuno, Binburrum moltres and Binburrum zapdos after three rare Pokémon: Articuno, Moltres and Zapdos. And, 10 years ago, Lessard bestowed the name of another giant of popular culture upon another fly. He named the Scaptia beyonceae fly after the \"Queen Bee\" herself -- Beyoncé -- in a move that he said was deemed in \"poor taste\" by some more traditional entomologists but which led to an increase in interest in the species.Lessard says part of the reason why the CSIRO is giving attention-grabbing names to insect species is to encourage greater interest amongst the public in invertebrates and to highlight the important role they play in biodiversity.Opaluma rupaul is difficult to miss, thanks to its sparkling appearance.\"Usually, it\\'s the cute and cuddly koalas that get all the attention when it comes to conservation efforts,\" Lessard explained. \"And the invertebrates are ignored -- despite the fact they\\'re the essential workers of the ecosystem that pollinate native flowers and agricultural crops that are grown to give us food. If we didn\\'t have that service from invertebrates, the world would be a terrible place.\"Beyond inspiring greater interest in invertebrates and encouraging the next generation of entomologists and scientists to seek out new species, Lessard also hopes that naming the soldier fly after an LGBTQ+ icon like RuPaul will let young LGBTQ+ people know that there are other gay scientists out there and that there is a place for them in the world of science.\"As a gay scientist, it took me a long time to feel comfortable in my own skin in a very traditional field of science -- in entomology,\" Lessard said. \"I think it\\'s really important for the next generation of LGBTQ+ scientists to know that they\\'re being represented in the workplace, as we give the names of legends in the community to memorable species.\"',\n",

Vaccination has been slower in the Eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia, where vaccination rates are at 59% and 62.2% respectively, according to Ministry of Health figures.  \"The truth is that there would be far fewer Covid-19 patients in [intensive care] if everyone who could do it got a vaccination,\" Spahn said.Covid chaos grips the East and uncertainty haunts the West. Europe is entering its second pandemic winter Read MoreHe also called to strengthen checks at public venues where only those with proof of vaccination or a Covid-19 recovery certificate will be granted entry. \"This has nothing to do with harassment to vaccinate, it is mainly about avoiding overloading the health system, as we see in Saxony and Thuringia,\" he said.  Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) -- the German federal government agency for disease control and prevention -- told the same press conference, \"If we don\\'t act now, this fourth wave will still bring a lot of suffering. Many people will become seriously ill and die, and the health care system will be heavily burdened.\" Pressure on hospitals The German Hospital Association (DKG) also warned Wednesday of Covid-19 releated staff shortages. According to a DKG poll, 72% of hospitals said they had less staff in intensive care on hand than at the end of 2020. And 86% of those hospitals said they cannot operate their intensive care wards fully because of staff shortages,Reasons for that shortage are, according to the DKG, staff resignations and shorter working hours due to the pressures of the pandemic.On Wednesday,  the state of Baden-Wurttemberg imposed new Covid-10 restrictions after more than 250 intensive care beds were filled up for two consecutive days. Residents will now need to present a negative Covid-19 test no older than 48 hours to enter restaurants and cinemas.German Chancellor Angela Merkel is \"very worried\"  about decreasing hospital capacity, according to German government spokesman Steffen Seibert at another press conference on Wednesday.Why the world is still arguing over face masks, 20 months into the pandemic \"What worries her just as much is that we continue to have more than 16 million unvaccinated adults in Germany, more than 3 million unvaccinated over the age of 60,\" he said. \"The pandemic is not, like some in the summer may have imagined, on the decrease, but it is challenging us now and will do so greatly in the coming weeks,\" Seibert added.Despite the widescale availability of vaccines this winter compared to the last, Europe is the only part of the world reporting an increase in new Covid-19 cases globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week. The suffering has been acute in Eastern Europe and Russia, which are battling mounting deaths and cases fueled by vaccine hesitancy that has seen coverage rates dip as low as 24%, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Differing vaccination rates have put Europe\\'s East and West on two separate tracks, but they share rising case rates driven by the relaxation of pandemic restrictions as economies open, cold weather driving people indoors, and the highly transmissible Delta variant, say experts.

(CNN)Do you ever walk outside, having just checked the weather, and the wind punches you in the face?The exposed parts of your body may feel like they\\'re freezing. This phenomenon is called wind chill.That\\'s right, the weather term isn\\'t a myth. Wind chill is real, so here\\'s some facts to help you understand what it means and how to protect yourself:What is wind chill?Wind chill is essentially how cold people and animals feel when they\\'re outside, according to the National Weather Service.Read MoreWind chill is based on how much heat is lost from exposed skin while it\\'s windy and cold. The faster the wind, the more heat is drawn from the body, which lowers the skin temperature and, ultimately, the internal body temperature. Cold casualty: What to know about hypothermia\"The critical thing is how long you can expose your skin before freezing,\" said Tom Sater, CNN meteorologist. \"When the winds are stronger, it can whip the heat away from your body quicker.\"Wind chill only applies to people and animals, the NWS says. The only effect wind chill has on inanimate objects -- such as cars or water pipes -- is that it shortens the amount of time it takes for the object to cool. Why is it dangerous?Wind chill can lead to frostbite, hypothermia and, ultimately, death.Frostbite is caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. It\\'s most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin, according to the Mayo Clinic. Severe cases can kill body tissue.Hypothermia occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce it, the Mayo Clinic says. Left untreated, it can lead to the failure of the heart and respiratory system and, eventually, death.How is wind chill measured?The NWS says wind chill is for temperatures at or below 50 degrees and wind speeds above 3 mph. Wind chill \"takes into account the wind and how cold it is,\" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward says. So, the colder it is and the stronger the wind, the lower the wind chill. In 2001, the NWS launched a new wind chill temperature index that features a useful formula for calculating the dangers of winter winds and freezing temperatures.What\\'s the difference between wind chill and wind speed?Wind speed is just how strong the wind is, Ward says. \"Temperature and wind speed are the two components that go into the formula to figure out the wind chill, which is how cold it actually feels,\" he said.When are wind chill advisories or warnings issued?Wind chill advisory and warning criteria are issued locally, the National Weather Service says.For example, wind chill advisories in New York City start at -15 degrees and warnings at -25. A man walks through snow-covered Barney Allis Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri. In Chicago, advisories start at -20 degrees and warnings at -30 degrees. And in Atlanta, advisories start at 5 degrees and warnings at -10. Ward says the criteria for a wind chill warning or advisory is a sliding scale and takes climatology into account. \"People in the upper Midwest are most accustomed to the cold so the wind chill has to be lower than a place like the South to prompt a warning,\" he said. How can people fight against wind chill?Layers, layers and more layers. \"Cover all exposed skin. Face masks help,\" Sater said. Marvin Hooks wears a face mask to protect him from the cold in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.There is a myth about hats flying around that people need to wear one because 80% of the body\\'s heat escapes from the head. Sater says exposing the head to wind chill and cold temperatures is no different than exposing an arm or leg. ',\n",

Add in blowing wind and poor visibility, and travel can become downright dangerous. And driving in a snow squall is next to impossible. weather, What are snow squalls and why they\\'re more dangerous than blizzards - CNN What are snow squalls and why they\\'re more dangerous than blizzards  (CNN)Driving in a snow storm is difficult. Add in blowing wind and poor visibility, and travel can become downright dangerous. And driving in a snow squall is next to impossible.\"There is no safe place on a highway during a snow squall,\" the National Weather Service (NWS) warned.A snow squall is an intense, but limited duration, period of moderate to heavy snowfall, accompanied by strong, gusty surface winds and possibly lightning. Snow accumulation may be significant. The phenomenon is not new, but the term and warnings associated with it only began in 2018.Snow squalls are different from a typical snow storm mainly because they are much shorter-lived, but also because they often have something called a flash freeze. Rapidly falling temperatures along with the freshly fallen snow can quickly glaze highways.\"The flash freeze is what separates snow squalls from a run-of-the-mill snow shower, which happens all the time,\" said John Banghoff, a meteorologist at the NWS in State College, PennsylvaniaRead More\"The flash freeze component essentially makes travel and controlling a vehicle next to impossible,\" added Jonathan Guseman, Warning Coordination Meteorologist at the NWS office in State College.Do you know what a snow squall is? Did you know we have a warning for that? #WinterWeatherAwarenessWeek #okwx #arwx pic.twitter.com/loPAQ7Sfyv— NWS Tulsa (@NWStulsa) December 1, 2021\\n\\nSnow squalls versus blizzardsThere are two main types of snow squalls: frontal and lake effect.Frontal snow squalls occur ahead, along, or behind an arctic front. The front provides the moisture and wind variables needed, and a very intense squall line develops producing the narrow bands of heavy snowfall. Very similar to a line of severe storms with tornadoes or damaging winds that occur in warmer temperatures, snow squalls are narrow but very intense.A snow squall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any given geographic point along its path, however, the entire line stretched out from its forward movement can cover large distances.\"A snow squall often occurs along an arctic front and the plummeting temperatures behind the snow squall turn wet pavement into a sheet of ice, making snow squalls much more dangerous than snow \\'bursts\\',\" Guseman noted. Lake effect snow squalls occur only near a large body of water. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air, often originating from Canada, moves across the warmer waters of the Great Lakes. The two types of events differ in duration. Lake effect snow squalls can extend long distances inland, and can persist for many hours. Snow accumulations can exceed 6 inches in a matter of hours.Today is the last day of Snow Squall Awareness Week. Snow squalls are one of the most dangerous winter weather phenomena.

Snow squall warnings are focused on very distinct, localized areas (like tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings).There is \\'no safe place\\' on a road during a snow squallThe greatest threat from snow squalls is travel. Visibility declines rapidly during snow squalls making travel almost impossible. Guseman and Banghoff emphasized planning ahead and knowing when snow squalls are possible are key to avoiding getting caught on the road.However, if you do get caught in one, Guseman and Banghoff have some tips• First, remain calm. Panicking will not help.• Try to safely exit the highway at the next available opportunity• Don\\'t make any quick or sudden movements (gradually reduce your speed and increase following distance)• Make yourself as visible as you can by turning on your headlights and hazard lightsAs Snow Squall Awareness Week comes to an end, check out https://t.co/SZAvOhvtug for a recap of all the content you\\'ve seen this week.

That\\'s what I love about boxing,\" adds Aburahma, who spoke to CNN earlier this year, before the recent uptick in the violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.She discovered the noble art almost by accident, but with every hook and jab, Aburahma is now on a mission to change the world around her; boxing has become her rallying cry to Arab women and females everywhere.Having graduated with a degree in English and French literature from Al Azhar University, Gaza, Aburahma has struggled to find work, and she\\'s not very optimistic about the prospects for either her generation or the next in the narrow Palestinian territory which has been subjected to Israel and Egypt\\'s crippling blockade since 2007. Read MoreUnder the blockade, Israel and Egypt regulates civilian movement and the import of basic goods into Gaza. \\u200bIsrael controls Gaza\\'s airspace, its naval borders and most of its land frontiers -- Egypt participates in the land blockade by restricting movement through the enclave\\'s Rafah border crossing in the south.The territory is just under 140 square miles in size, but home to nearly two million people. That\\'s roughly the same size as Detroit, but with nearly three times the population.Israeli officials say these measures are necessary to prevent armed groups from smuggling weapons or carrying out attacks on Israel. Palestinians say the measures are violent and oppressive.CNN interviewed Aburahma about her boxing passion before the latest round of violence between Gaza militants and Israel this May. At least 256 Palestinians were killed by Israeli airstrikes, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. Twelve civilians in Israel were killed by Hamas rockets, according to Israeli officials. Israel\\'s bombing campaign wreaked havoc in Gaza, destroying scores of residential buildings and wiping out whole families, according to Gaza\\'s Ministry of Health.  Speaking to CNN amongst the recovery work following the latest round of violence, Aburahma says, \"There is no other option. We have to keep living. We have to rebuild it again and again until one day, maybe, we can be free.\"Aburahma knows people who\\'ve tried to escape Gaza in search of a better life, one of them her friend who drowned at sea, but she doesn\\'t believe that giving up on her homeland is the answer. \"We like Gaza and we like our friends and family here. And we would like to make a change for the better. The situation is very bad. But if we run away, who is going to solve these problems?\"Preparing to box.\\'Boxing is like blood in my body\\'When she was just two years old, conflict in Gaza forced Aburahma\\'s family to move into the Shabura Refugee Camp in Rafah.Her early memories of any kind of sporting activity were playing games in the streets. By the time she had turned four, her family was able to find a better life and they relocated to Gaza City. Her sister played football and Aburahma took up Dabke -- a traditional folk dance. She says there wasn\\'t much emphasis on sport at school, but she would sometimes lift weights at the gym and tried other activities, but nothing ever really stuck. Everything changed, though, when she stumbled across a video clip of Osama Ayob on Facebook last year, training girls how to box. Aburahma was intrigued and called him up, asking if he would teach her, too. Word got around and 10 other girls went along with her to try it out; now, it\\'s a team of around 45 boxers in two small locations, ranging in age from seven to 35 -- children, teenagers, young adults and mothers. It is the first -- and only -- all-women\\'s boxing team in Gaza. \"Boxing is like blood in my body,\" Ayob told CNN. \"I have loved boxing since I was a little kid; I adore it. I taught my sons and my daughters boxing, even my wife.\" Ayob boxed all over the Arab world and when he returned to Gaza in 2013, he started introducing the sport to Palestinian women, initially outdoors on the beach -- in public -- an attempt to normalize a combat sport in a strict, conservative society. \"One of the biggest challenges I had was the way the society is looking at those girls,\" Ayob recalled. \"People would say look at those girls, what they are doing instead of being at home beside their mothers. We changed the way the society is looking at those girls.\" The coach says that if he had enough space, he would already have 100 girls training. While boxing seems to be a popular new choice for some women in Gaza, some of those heading to the gym and lacing up their gloves have been made well aware of the resistance to it. \"Many people called the coach and threatened him,\" said Aburahma, \"They told him to stop or they would do bad things to him.\"The girls were afraid at first; the coach was afraid. He asked us not to post anything [on social media] for a while.\" She lists all the things that were said about women boxing in Gaza: \"She\\'s going to be violent; she\\'s going to look like a man; you look stupid, you look ugly.\"She said some blog commentors even talked about circulating the names of the boxers so that nobody would marry them in the future, \"by mistake.\"\"It\\'s actually kind of funny to read something like, \\'We don\\'t want to marry these guys.\\' It\\'s like, \\'What made you think that we want to marry someone like you, with this kind of mentality?\"\"We changed the way the society is looking at those girls,\" says boxing coach Osama Ayob.According to a 2019 Violence Survey conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 29% of currently or ever-married women reported some kind of violence (psychological, physical, sexual, social or economic) by their husbands in the previous 12 months, and the violence was much more prevalent in Gaza than in the West Bank -- 38% to 24%More recent reports have revealed why there might be an even greater urgency for women to learn self-defense. As domestic tensions have increased during the pandemic, cases of femicide have spiked.The Women\\'s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling documented 37 cases in 2020, compared to 21 the previous year. Their research of femicide over a three-year period revealed that most of the victims were below the age of 29 and the perpetrators were brothers, husbands, fathers and even sons. A report by UN Women concluded in 2018 that 50% of Palestinian women and 63% of Palestinian men agreed that a woman should tolerate violence in order to keep the family together.Aburahma knows how it feels to be vulnerable, although she hadn\\'t necessarily pieced all the elements of her own story together until she was sharing it with CNN.\"We are in a society that is not used to seeing girls out in the streets at night, girls who look like me,\" she explained. \"One night, at about 8 or 9 o\\'clock, a man followed me, and I was really scared. I wasn\\'t strong, I couldn\\'t defend myself; so I had to call my father. When he saw that, he ran; he was a coward. But I don\\'t want to be afraid.\"Four times in her life -- in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021 -- she\\'s witnessed conflict in Gaza, sometimes perilously close. She says she\\'s seen military tanks in her neighborhood, missiles in the sky, buildings exploding and bodies flying through the air. She remembers her cousin being shot in the shoulder and her aunt crying in the street, and she remembers cowering in terror, thinking she was going to die. When she was 10 years old, Israeli ground troops moved into Gaza as part of Operation Cast Lead. One night, her family had to evacuate in their pajamas, and when they returned home several weeks later, they realized how lucky they had been to survive.\"There were many shots [bullet holes] in our house and my bed was damaged. It is under the window and the glass had shattered. So that made me cry a lot; if I was sleeping, I would have died.\"Israel says it launched the 2008 operation to stop militant groups from firing rockets into southern Israel. More than 1,400 Palestinians died, according to officials in Gaza. The Israeli military says 1,166 people were killed, and that more than half were militants.At such a tender age, Aburahma was realizing -- albeit subconsciously -- that she would need to learn how to stand up for herself. \"The idea that my father can protect me from anything started to end because I realized -- at 10 years old -- there are things that are bigger than us, bigger than my father. He can\\'t protect us from everything.\"When asked how she thought the experience of war had shaped her as a person, Aburahma concluded: \"I\\'ve always felt the need to protect myself. I thought this is because of the boy who followed me in the street or because of the society, the harassment I had because of being a woman. But you made me realize that war might have been a part of this feeling. But I\\'m only realizing this right now.\"The women\\'s boxing team is new and exciting for the athletes, but the future is unclear.Coach Ayob showed CNN how some of the equipment in the gym has been repurposed from everyday materials.\"I had mattresses at home; I cut them and made [punching blocks] out of them. This bag as well is made of very simple material.\" Much of it is held together with parcel tape; the 14-year blockade has made professional equipment hard to come by.He says he\\'d welcome assistance in order to improve and expand: \"I cannot train 40 to 50 girls in eight meters square. I need someone to support us financially, so we can improve to the level of the other international teams.\"The women\\'s team might be pioneering, but they\\'re still an outlier in Gaza society: they can\\'t compete in local championships, as the boys and men would. Aburahma adds that some of the girls in the team have expressed interest in becoming professional boxers and competing internationally, but the hope of anybody doing that depends on outside aid, a sponsor -- somebody to pay for passports and travel, not to mention decent equipment and uniforms.\"I am afraid that one day these younger girls are going to grow up and they\\'re not going to find another woman to box,\" she said, explaining her motive to keep growing the sport at home. \"For me personally, I did not dream of participating in championships or becoming very professional in boxing, but I dream of becoming a boxing coach because a lot of girls choose not to join our team because we have a male coach. I need to respect this, but at the same time, I want girls to be strong and to practice this kind of sport.\"I\\'ll try to become a good boxer in order to help other women. I believe in empowering them and giving them the opportunity to become stronger. I believe in the idea; I believe in women.\"Boxing sanctuaryThe gyms may be small, and the facilities may be spartan, but for the girls and women who have joined up, it\\'s a sanctuary, a safe place to express themselves and channel their emotions. Nesma Abu Shammala, an 18-year-old university student, told CNN, \"My favorite thing about boxing is that I can discharge the negative energy that I have and be empty of stress, anxiety and nervousness. It makes me feel full of positive energy.\"Long readsAustralia\\'s first international cricketers won fame abroad.

Girls as young as seven years old are going at it; others practice balancing on an old tire or trying to jab at tennis balls or plastic bottles attached to a string. Aburahma has tied her hair up into a high ponytail and is dressed in an all-black tracksuit. Her bright red gloves are pounding away on the pads, her diminutive frame dwarfed by the coach.  One girl is playfully dancing to the music, uninhibited, enjoying the laughter and encouragement from the others; there are fist bumps and supportive gestures and hugs for the younger fighters. \"I always say that sport changes lives,\" explains Aburahma, \"If it changes lives step by step, it can make a huge change in the world.  I\\'ve experienced that sport changes the way of thinking. It makes people more open and more positive, more open to change and more open to accept the differences of other people.\" She details the range of social and cultural backgrounds of the boxers and how their involvement is changing more than just the narrative on the Arab woman\\'s place in the world. \"I\\'ve experienced girls from conservative families, girls who had a hard time convincing their parents. When they came, they saw these other girls who do not dress like them, who do not think like them, have different backgrounds and different families. \"Step by step, they all became friends. So, if this sport could change the mentality of someone who was determined that girls are not allowed to do something violent or to dress like this or be friends with people like this, that is a huge thing.\"As word of their boxing team has traveled, the curiosity has drawn media and interview requests.

Here's a brief recap, and what to watch for. sport, MLB playoffs: Dynasties and bragging rights are at stake  - CNN Dynasties and bragging rights are at stake as the MLB playoffs heat up   (CNN)After a truncated, pandemic-hobbled 2020, the MLB playoffs have come roaring back in full force. A wild end of September saw several teams fighting for spots in the postseason right up until the final regular season game, and some World Series favorites still catching their breath after 11th-hour playoff clinches. Now, after Chris Taylor's dramatic home run Wednesday night lifted the defending champs Los Angeles Dodgers past the St. Louis Cardinals, eight teams remain. In the American League, the Tampa Bay Rays will battle the Boston Red Sox while the Chicago White Sox face off against the Houston Astros. Over in the National League, the Atlanta Braves face the Milwaukee Brewers while the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants meet in an epic clash between archrivals with the two best records in baseball.Read MoreHere's a recap of the late-season twists and turns that got us here, and a look at the best playoff storylines.Two bitter East Coast rivals squeak into the playoffsEvery once in a precious while, 162 regular-season games just aren't enough to paint a full postseason picture. Only 16 times in MLB history have tiebreaker matchups been needed to determine division winners or wild-card spots. Fans this year were itching for some Game 163 action in the American League, which could have ended in a three- or even four-way tie for the wild card.But the Yankees and Red Sox both clinched playoff spots on the very last day of the regular season, edging the surging Toronto Blue Jays and surprising Seattle Mariners. The Boston Red Sox celebrate with champagne in their clubhouse after winning the 2021 American League wild card game against the New York Yankees.And the drama wasn't over! That set up a crucial one-and-done duel between the two most storied rivals in baseball. The Red Sox beat the Yankees, 6-2, on Tuesday before a thunderous home crowd at Fenway Park and now face the Rays, who easily won the AL East division. The Rays have their own score to settle, though: They lost last year's World Series to the Dodgers. On the West Coast, the returning champs face a resurgent dynasty The Los Angeles Dodgers are loaded with talent, won 106 games and are favorites to repeat their 2020 World Series glory. But they came very close to not even making it this far -- thanks to their divisional rivals, the San Francisco Giants, who won 107 games and snatched the NL West division title from the Dodgers on the very last day of the season. Justin Turner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He hit a crucial home run in Wednesday's wild card game.That sent the Dodgers to the NL wild-card game to face the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cards were heavy underdogs, but in a one-game playoff, anything can happen.For a while it looked like the Cardinals might hold on to an early 1-0 lead and shock the champs,  but the baseball gods would not be denied. The Dodgers tied the game, then won it with Taylor's stunning blast in the bottom of the ninth inning -- only the fifth time in MLB history that a postseason, winner-take-all game ended with a walk-off home run.Now, poetically, the Dodgers will face the Giants in the divisional round. It's safe to say they'll be looking for revenge. The Giants, meanwhile, are looking for their first World Series win since their historic 2010, 2012 and 2014 championship runs. Two teams are gunning for their first-ever titlesWhile this year's playoff field is stocked with recent World Series champs (the Dodgers won in 2020, the Red Sox in 2018 and the Astros in 2017), the Milwaukee Brewers and the Tampa Bay Rays have never tasted sweet World Series victory. Tyrone Taylor of the Milwaukee Brewers scores  during a game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on July 29, 2021.Both are small-market franchises that have been to the World Series -- the Brewers only once, in 1982 -- but have never brought home the hardware.The Atlanta Braves have something to prove here, too. Their last World Series title came in 1995, making them the team with the longest championship drought among those remaining contenders who have won rings. And the Chicago White Sox have captured only one World Series crown in the last century -- in 2005, which to their fans probably feels like ancient history.Covid-19 may have altered the playoff pictureWhile many MLB teams relaxed Covid-19 protocols in the second half of the season, the specter of the pandemic still hovers over the playoffs.Major League Baseball requested that teams in 2021 reach at least an 85% vaccination rate among their players. Several teams that failed to reach that threshold hurt their playoff chances when key players were suspended due to Covid-19.A security guard checks Covid-19 vaccination cards before a game between the Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins on June 2, 2021.After a strong start to the season, for example, the Red Sox stumbled in the second half as many of their players were sidelined by positive covid tests. Boston still squeaked into the postseason, but other teams were not so lucky.Major League Baseball will require all non-playing personnel -- including managers, coaches and athletic trainers — to be vaccinated for Covid-19 in order to gain access to the field and other restricted areas during the postseason.When it comes to fans at playoff games, MLB is leaving coronavirus protocols, such as mask requirements, up to the individual teams. \",\n",

Giuliani claimed in a tweet on Friday that has since been removed by Twitter that the Capitol siege was carried out \"by groups like ANTIFA trained to riot.\"  Attorney for the President, Rudy Giuliani, speaks at a news conference in the parking lot of a landscaping company on November 7, 2020 in Philadelphia.Giuliani has zeroed in on self-described leftist activist John Earle Sullivan of Utah, who was charged in federal court Thursday on three counts related to the Capitol riot, and has argued that the presence and statements of Sullivan and other unidentified rioters indicate that the storming was driven by forces opposed to Trump.    \"We have people who invaded like Mr. Sullivan and his apparently Black Lives Matter directed group of rioters and looters and whatever else they are,\" Giuliani said in a Thursday episode of his podcast titled \"Another FRAME UP.\" What we know about potential armed protests ahead of Joe Biden\\'s inaugurationHe also claimed that the riot was something \"that the President had nothing to do with.\" Read MoreThe \"Antifa\" argument is just one of a number conspiracy theories Giuliani has pushed on behalf of Trump since the November election. Giuliani, who is still expected to play a role in Trump\\'s impeachment defense even though the President has told staff not to pay him, did not respond to CNN\\'s requests for comment.  Giuliani\\'s tweet was first reported by the Emptywheel blog, a site specializing in national security and civil liberties issues.In the now-removed Tweet, Giuliani included a screenshot of a text purportedly from Sullivan\\'s brother James in which the sender claimed to be working with the FBI \"to expose and place total blame on John\" and more than 200 members of Antifa. Neither Giuliani nor James Sullivan have produced evidence to support the claim that Antifa was involved in the January 6 riot. Federal law enforcement officials have said they have found no evidence suggesting Antifa played a significant role in the insurrection.John Sullivan and his brother James appear to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum.James Sullivan is an ardent Trump supporter, according to his Facebook page. He is also the co-founder of Civilized Awakenings, a civil rights organization that seeks to help Black conservatives \"find real solutions to the problems the Black Americans are facing.\" In a brief interview with CNN, a spokesperson for Civilized Awakenings confirmed Sullivan had spoken at a Proud Boys rally in Portland but stressed neither he nor Civilized Awakenings are part of that group. The spokesperson also confirmed Sullivan has been in contact with Rudy Giuliani, but declined to discuss the details. James Sullivan declined comment.Neither John Sullivan nor the attorney representing him on the charges stemming from the Capitol siege could be reached for comment Friday evening. Attorney Peter Kern, who represents Sullivan in a separate criminal case filed this summer in Utah declined to characterize any political affiliations Sullivan may have.275 cases open in Capitol riot investigation, US prosecutors sayDuring the siege, John Sullivan recorded the mayhem and provided commentary on what was going on. He was charged with disorderly conduct, interfering with law enforcement, and knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, according to a criminal complaint. He was taken into custody in Utah, where he lives.According to the complaint, Sullivan told the FBI he was an activist and journalist who filmed protests and riots, \"but admitted that he did not have any press credentials.\" He told agents he was wearing a ballistic vest and gas mask and entered the building through a broken window, the affidavit states. While standing outside the Capitol building before entering, he proclaimed, \"Let\\'s burn this sh*t down.\"Once inside, he can be heard on audio arguing with police and telling them to stand down or that they might get hurt, according to the affidavit.\"You are putting yourself in harm\\'s way,\" he allegedly told officers. \"The people have spoken.\" The arrest affidavit also says that as a crowd attempted to open doors to one part of the Capitol, Sullivan can be heard on the video saying, \"Hey guys, I have a knife. I have a knife. Let me up.\"Federal authorities have not identified John Sullivan as a member of Antifa, and he denied supporting Antifa in an interview with a Utah newspaper last week. Sullivan said in the same interview that he didn\\'t encourage violence or vandalism.When asked about some of the things he said during a 40-minute video he recorded of the incident, he said, \"When you\\'re in a massive crowd like that, you have to blend in.\"The paper, The Deseret News, also reported in July that Sullivan is part of a group called \"Insurgence USA\" and took part in a protest in June in which he and others demonstrated in opposition to a scheduled pro-law enforcement demonstration. The paper reported he was arrested after the protest and booked into jail for investigation of \"rioting, making a threat of violence and criminal mischief.\"That case is pending, online court records show. Kern said Sullivan\\'s arraignment had been postponed and he had yet to enter a plea. In August, Sullivan was in Washington, DC, speaking to a gathering at Black Lives Matter Plaza, according to a video on YouTube.\"We [expletive] about to burn this [expletive] down,\" he told the crowd. \"We got to rip Trump right out of that office over there.\"He then led the crowd in a chant of, \"It\\'s time for a revolution.\"In the aftermath of last week\\'s siege on the capitol, Sullivan appeared on CNN\\'s AC360 and ABC\\'s Good Morning America, commenting on dramatic footage he shot inside the Capitol.\"By no means am I there on the Trump side or the Biden side,\" he told Anderson Cooper.',\n",

Bluff or not, Putin is playing with fire - CNN Russian forces are massing on Ukraine\\'s border. Bluff or not, Putin is playing with fire London (CNN)For an army given to masking its moves, surely the worst way to disguise a potential imminent invasion of a country is by overtly preparing for it.This is the paradox around Russia\\'s visible buildup in its west, not far from the Ukrainian border. Were Moscow trying to reverse the military stalemate around the Donbas separatist region -- that it truncated from Ukraine in 2014 -- would it want to telegraph its moves so blatantly?Russia\\'s signals are obvious. Relentless social media videos show armored convoys moving towards the general border area. These led to open-source intelligence sleuths @CITeam_en spotting a congregation of likely hundreds of vehicles not far from the Russian city of Voronezh. That is still over 100 miles from Ukraine, but it is a sizeable buildup that was captured on satellite images from the Maxar technology group.A buildup of vehicles at the  Pogonovo training area, seen in Maxar\\'s satellite image.The White House said this week that Russia now has more troops near the Ukraine border than any time since 2014 -- when the peninsula of Crimea was annexed. Further south, military intelligence reports have assessed that some 4,000 heavily armed Russian forces had been seen moving in Crimea, a US defense official told CNN.Satellite images show huge Russian military buildup in the ArcticMoscow is also talking the game. Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu has announced snap readiness inspections for the army. The Kremlin\\'s envoy to the conflict, deputy head of the presidential administration Dmitri Kozak, said that Moscow would, as has pretty much always been implied, come to the defense of Ukraine\\'s eastern population if needed. And he said the start of a conflict would be the \"beginning of the end of Ukraine.\" Russia\\'s declarations are pretty noisy.Read MoreFor Ukraine\\'s part, President Volodymyr Zelensky has moved some units closer to the Donbas, and took a very high-profile trip to the area Thursday. Like Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Zelensky\\'s domestic ratings are not that healthy. He talked the language of peace. He tried to be close to the troops, aware that US President Joe Biden has said he will stand by him.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (right) handshakes with a soldier during his visit to a front in Donbas, Ukraine on April 08.The White House has said it is \"increasingly concerned by recent escalating Russian aggressions in eastern Ukraine\" and US officials have also hinted they might send warships to the Black Sea, a signal of increased involvement, even though American aircraft have regularly been monitoring that area. German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked Putin to pull his forces back during a call on Thursday. Everyone is getting very excitable, very fast.Speculation about what comes next in the biggest land war in Europe in two decades is as rife as the Kremlin surely hope it would be. Meanwhile, its sole cost so far is the fuel bill of moving a lot of tanks around.The key as-yet-unanswered question is what Russia\\'s objective would be in a military intervention. Some analysts have speculated it might flood the separatist areas and adjacent conflict zones with a huge Russian \"peacekeeping\" force, designed to impose its will and rules on the area -- effectively annexing the Donbas in earnest. Yet this would almost guarantee a Western response, likely at first in the form of sanctions. It would also achieve for Moscow essentially the same control it has now on these areas, albeit with lot of expensive Russian skin and hardware in the game. It is all the squeeze, with none of the juice, and so probably not that favorable to the Kremlin.A Ukrainian serviceman uses a periscope in a trench on the frontline with Russia-backed separatists near the town of Zolote, in the Lugansk region on April 8.The second option floated by analysts involves the creation of a land corridor between separatist Donbas in the east and Crimea, the annexed peninsula to the south of Ukraine. For years, water has been a scarce resource in Crimea, a crisis which a senior Ukrainian official warned me two years ago could reach a critical stage in the summer of 2019. It still persists, along with the broader challenge for Moscow of maintaining a passable standard of life in Crimea through sea supplies, and over a small, new bridge it has made across the Kerch Strait. It is not a sustainable state of affairs for Russia\\'s latest acquisition in the long term.US considering sending warships to Black Sea amid Russia-Ukraine tensionsBut a land corridor -- a strip running through the Ukrainian town of Mariupol and to the Armiansk area above Crimea -- would also be extremely vulnerable for any occupying Russian forces. They would be caught between the Azov Sea and a very angry, better-equipped-than-before, Ukrainian army. To hold that corridor effectively, they would have to push deeper into Ukraine, and then face yet more resistance from the Ukrainian army and the local population. Long gone is the hope from 2014 that Russian soldiers would be seen as \"liberators\" from a corrupt Kiev government. Hostility is much more palpable.So the task ahead of the Russian army is either do so little that the inevitable Western sanctions seem imposed for minimal gain. Or do so much (way too much) that you have to occupy large swathes of Ukraine for years. It\\'s a mess both ways.In Moscow\\'s eyes then, a perhaps much better option is to amass its forces, make loud noises about Ukraine\\'s desire for war, hint at diplomacy and use its heavy-metal-gloved-hand across the border to force a better, negotiated solution. This of course presumes the Kremlin head is always making the best decisions. Putin is also capable of overreach or folly.Russian President Vladimir Putin during a concert in Moscow marking the seventh anniversary of the Crimea annexation, on March 18.A third invasion of Ukraine in 2021 is also a much more dangerous gamble for Putin than the one he took in 2014-15. US President Biden has made it clear he\\'ll offer \"unwavering support\" to Kiev. Washington\\'s mindset is irrevocably hardened to the idea that Russia is a threat. And Ukrainian leader Zelensky, as politically and militarily inexperienced as he is, will doubtless benefit domestically from being dragged into a conflict he hasn\\'t started.Yet two enduring, unquantifiable risks remain. The first is that Putin may see, among all the chaos of the next few weeks, a moment of opportunity to strike, and simply decide to deal with the consequences later. The second is the inevitable peril of amassing angry forces on both sides of an already active front line. An unanticipated error or surge by either party could spiral into a bigger war. If Moscow hopes its buildup means its phones start ringing more frequently, and diplomacy takes over, then it would better happen soon.',\n",

Now he -- and thousands of others who say they\\'re fleeing a repressive government and searching for economic opportunity -- are taking their first steps in the United States. As America\\'s newest immigrants search for places to put down roots, refugee agencies say they\\'re struggling to deal with the influx, and politicians are sparring over whether this group of immigrants should be here in the first place. It\\'s a familiar refrain, but one with a twist: Because they\\'re Cuban, these immigrants are in the United States legally the second they arrive, regardless of how they get here.

But the family\\'s efforts to make a living there didn\\'t work out. \"They didn\\'t pay us. ... It was worse than Cuba,\" says Paloma\\'s husband, Julio Cesar Valle Hernandez.That\\'s a common thread in many of the stories shared by Cubans streaming into church-run shelters in El Paso, where they swap details of their harrowing journeys north:The financial hardships they faced in Cuba. The low wages they earned working as undocumented immigrants in Ecuador. The South American country\\'s threats to deport them. The dangers of hiking for days through the Colombian jungle, facing rough terrain, armed groups and extortion by authorities. The fear they\\'d never make it out of Panama, where many of them were stranded for months after Nicaragua and Costa Rica closed their borders.Experts say several factors are fueling a spike in the number of Cubans to brave this dangerous journey to reach the United States. Chief among them: fear that U.S. policies that put Cubans on a fast track to legal residency could be repealed as relations between the two countries improve.For El Paso residents who\\'ve stepped up to help the arriving immigrants, the conversations have been eye-opening.\"It\\'s been a roller coaster,\" says Veronica Román, executive director of the Houchen Community Center, the first stop for more than 1,700 Cubans who arrived in the past few weeks. \"It\\'s a lot of mixed emotions when you hear their stories. ...

But the trip was worth it, he says, to give his children a future. And still, he says, it was better than what his brother went through, trying to leave Cuba on a boat -- only to find himself stranded at sea for five days on a rickety raft, rescued by the Coast Guard and deported back.\"At least in the mountains,\" Valle says, \"there is earth under your feet.\" Photos: What they broughtYordanis Garcia Milian, 28, knew he couldn\\'t leave Cuba without a snapshot from his surprise 15th birthday party.

For now, days after he arrived in America, he\\'s cooking food at a shelter where Cubans who\\'ve just crossed into the United States are staying in El Paso, Texas.Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: What they broughtNuñez also brought a beaded necklace with him that he\\'s had since he was 18 years old.Hide Caption 7 of 7An unlikely locationAs Lorenzo sweeps the floor, the Rev. Karl Heimer leans back in the church office chair that\\'s become the center of a makeshift barbershop. He doesn\\'t have much hair left, but the Cuban barber has found a way to trim it.\"How do I look?\" the 75-year-old pastor asks him. \"Can\\'t you add a little hair on the top?\"Heimer has spent decades working at this Lutheran mission less than a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border.He brings Bibles to jailed Central American and Mexican immigrants and hosts mission groups who build houses just across the border in Ciudad Juarez.\"Never did I think I\\'d be helping my own people,\" says Heimer. The pastor left his home in Guantánamo, Cuba, in the 1950s to study in the United States; after Fidel Castro came to power, Heimer applied for refugee status. Now, the mission he runs has become a shelter for dozens of Cubans who\\'ve just arrived in El Paso and have nowhere else to go. \"I\\'m loving it, (but) it makes me feel like crying sometimes, because of my mother,\" Heimer says. A proud Cuban from the coastal city of Cienfuegos, she came to the United States in the early 1960s and lived with him in Texas before she died in 1997. He knows she would have gotten a kick out of the arrival of so many Cubans in such an unlikely place. \"The sad thing about it is she couldn\\'t be here to see it.\" For many years, it would have been unthinkable to see a wave of Cuban immigrants walking across pedestrian border bridges that stretch across the Rio Grande and into this land-locked city. But times have changed. While the U.S. Coast Guard says it has seen a spike in the number of Cubans trying to reach the United States on boats, far more are coming to the country on land.More than 35,600 Cubans have arrived at U.S. ports of entry since October 1, nearly three-quarters of them at the Texas border, according to U.S. figures. More than 4,700 crossed in El Paso alone, according to a CNN tally using numbers from U.S. and Mexican immigration officials. And the numbers show no sign of slowing.It\\'s a blessing, Heimer says, to have so many skilled immigrants arriving. Lawyers, doctors and engineers are among the Cubans who made it to Texas this month.\"They will add to our society,\" Heimer says.The Rev. Karl Heimer left Cuba for the United States in the 1950s; the recent wave of migrants has taken him by surprise.Washington weighs inThe papers stapled into their passports are stamped with words that give Cubans a leg up the second they step foot in the United States: \"Paroled to pursue adjustment of status under public law 89-732.\"While immigrants from other countries seeking asylum in the United States often struggle to make their case in court, Cubans don\\'t have to jump over the same hurdles. The Cuban Adjustment Act, passed in 1966, gives any Cuban who sets foot in the United States permission to enter. After a year and a day in the country, they\\'re eligible to apply for a green card.Other government policies grant them benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance and work permits soon after their arrival.Snapshot: Cuban migrationPrompted in part by fears that thawing relations with Cuba will end favorable U.S. policies, thousands of Cuban immigrants are trekking through Latin America on their way to the United States. Here\\'s a snapshot of other countries involved:Ecuador was once a magnet for Cuban migrants because the South American country didn\\'t require entry visas. That practice ended last year, and many Cubans are leaving with the threat of deportation looming. Nicaragua in Central America closed its border to Cubans heading north last year, leaving thousands stranded to the south in Costa Rica.Costa Rica struck a deal in January to begin airlifting Cubans out of the country, then closed its borders to stop more from coming in. That left thousands stranded to the south in Panama.Panama began humanitarian airlifts this month that sent more than 3,100 stranded Cubans north to Mexico at the U.S. border. Now Panama\\'s borders are closed, too.Mexico gives Cubans arriving on flights from Central America temporary papers and shuttles them to the U.S. border.In recent months, a number of U.S. lawmakers have slammed the Cuban Adjustment Act, claiming it gives Cubans an unfair advantage and allows scammers to exploit the system.\"There\\'s no logical reason to give preference to Cubans over immigrants from other countries around the world. ... The Cold War is over. We\\'re normalizing relations with Cuba,\" says Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke, a Democrat who represents El Paso in Congress.It doesn\\'t make sense, O\\'Rourke says, for Salvadorans, Hondurans and Mexicans fleeing violence to get turned away from the United States while Cubans are welcomed without question.\"I want to make sure that this country treats all people who come to our shores and come to our borders with dignity and respect and helps those who are in the greatest need,\" he says. \"We shouldn\\'t, for political purposes, help one group of people over another.\"Speaking on the Senate floor last week, Sen. Marco Rubio said the issue \"needs to be re-examined.\"\"We have a significant migratory crisis that\\'s building,\" the Florida Republican said of the \"historic increase\" of Cubans crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.Rubio, whose parents were Cuban immigrants, said he\\'s proposing a measure that would let Cubans keep some privileges but crack down on abuses of federal benefits by ending \"the automatic assumption in U.S. law that all Cuban immigrants are refugees.\"\"You\\'ll be legal in this country,\" Rubio said, \"but you\\'re going to have to prove that you are actually coming because you fear persecution before you automatically qualify for refugee benefits.\"Cuban officials also criticize U.S. policies, saying they encourage Cubans to risk their lives on harrowing journeys and expose them to criminal exploitation. Obama administration officials have repeatedly said they have no plans to push for policy changes toward Cubans who arrive on U.S. soil.No matter what lawmakers decide, many of the Cubans arriving in El Paso this month say it won\\'t make a difference. \"The policy could change,\" says Cleyzak Muñoz, 34, a merchant from Havana who just arrived. \"But what is not going to change is the immigration, because I don\\'t think that Cuba will ever change.\"Julio Rojas Rubio, a 33-year-old computer engineer who arrived in El Paso earlier this month, says politicians weighing whether to change U.S. policies toward Cuba should go live there for a few months.\"They would see that most people are leaving Cuba because of a problem with the regime,\" he says. \"Economically, I wasn\\'t doing badly in Cuba. I took care of my family. I lived well. But the regime didn\\'t let me live. ... They repress you. Everything is controlled.\"Julio Rojas Rubio was a computer engineer in Cuba; he\\'s been volunteering as a cook at a shelter since arriving in El Paso.Two journeys, one destinationBy day, Lorenzo cut hair at his shop, Barberia El Estilo, in the central Cuban city of Camaguey.But outside work, he says, he participated in groups that opposed Castro and brought food to jailed political prisoners.Authorities, he says, threatened him and detained him for days at a time. Lorenzo says political persecution, not economic necessity, forced him to flee to Ecuador, then head to the United States.\"In this country,\" he says, \"there is freedom of expression.\" As Lorenzo describes his run-ins with Cuban authorities, Alexi Fernandez del Risco nods in agreement. The 35-year-old welder also hails from Camaguey, where Lorenzo started cutting his hair when he was just a toddler.Things got so bad, Fernandez says, that he tried to leave the island 11 times by boat. Once, he made it as far as Grand Cayman before he got sent back.Lorenzo and Fernandez left Cuba and headed to Ecuador separately. The old friends ran into each other by chance this year in Panama, long after Lorenzo last gave Fernandez a haircut. \"I arrived dying of hunger and I saw him and I couldn\\'t believe my eyes. We hugged there in the street,\" Fernandez says. Together, they made it onto the last plane out of Panama.\"We arrived together and we\\'re going to stay together,\" Fernandez says.But now that they\\'ve made it to the United States, they\\'ve been sparring over where to go next.Lessons learnedNorberto Lázaro leans on the cafeteria table and rubs his forehead.It\\'s only been an hour since he arrived in the United States. He was on the plane that landed in Ciudad Juarez this morning. But it took all day to make it through the U.S. checkpoint. By the time he met volunteers standing outside the Customs and Border Protection facility, the sky was already dark.\"I feel like I\\'m dreaming,\" he says.Rick Vielma interrupts the reverie, asking him whether he has a plan now that he\\'s made it to the United States.Lázaro says he\\'s ready to start working.\"I want to go up,\" he says. \"I want to go to Alaska.\"Vielma tells him he might want to wait before making such a long journey.\"A lot of people when they get here, they\\'re very cold, because of the air conditioning,\" he says. \"It\\'s even colder there.\"Vielma speaks Spanish with a Mexican accent. Lázaro asks him if he\\'s from the United States. \"I\\'m a first-generation American, the first in our family born in the United States. My father is from Aguascalientes and my mother is from Ciudad Juarez. I can\\'t imagine everything you\\'ve gone through,\" he says. \"That\\'s why I\\'m here. ... My sympathy and my heart are with you.\"For weeks, Vielma and his 10-year-old son have been stopping by the center to serve food, answer phones and help Cubans figure out their next steps.Vielma says some of his acquaintances have criticized their efforts. \"They say, \\'Why the f--- are you helping the Cubans? You\\'ve got family in Juarez.\\' But people are desperately in need of sleep, of showers, of someone to talk to,\" Vielma says. \"You can\\'t just turn away from this kind of thing.\"It\\'s a lesson he hopes his son will never forget.\"I want him to see that it\\'s OK to give,\" Vielma says, \"to see what people are really made of.\"     \\'Are you happy?\\'The voices of dozens of students repeating their teacher\\'s words bounce off the classroom\\'s concrete floors.\"I am ... you are ... he is ... she is ... we are ... they are ...y\\'all are.\"\"You\\'re in Texas,\" the Rev. Steven Massey tells his class, \"so we\\'re going to try to be good Texans.\"\"Y\\'all,\" he says again.\"Y\\'all,\" they parrot back.Just over one-tenth of 1% of El Paso\\'s population is Cuban, according to 2010 Census figures, which show 737 Cubans living in the border city. This month, more than 3,100 Cubans were flown from Panama City to Ciudad Juarez and bused to the U.S. border, Mexican immigration officials said. Many of the Cubans say they plan to make their way to bigger cities like Miami and Houston. But local officials estimate hundreds may stay in El Paso. Massey came to El Paso from his home in St. Johns, Michigan, to help start English classes for them.His immediate goal: teach them a few words and phrases they can use right away as they start to find their footing.From pronouns and conjugations, Massey moves on to questions.\"Where are you?\" Massey tells them. \"You say, \\'I am in El Paso, Texas.\\'\"\"Why are you here?\" he continues. Then he pauses for a moment. \"I know it\\'s not a simple answer. You start with saying, \\'I am here because ...\\'\"\"Are you happy?\" Massey asks over and over, calling on students around the room. All of them say yes.At the back of the class, Daiye Naranjo Sánchez turns toward her husband and smiles sympathetically.She can tell he\\'s frustrated. He\\'s looking toward the white board with a blank stare. \"For him, it\\'s like there\\'s a wall inside,\" Naranjo says. But she\\'s doing everything she can to persuade him not to get discouraged. She hopes he\\'ll become as determined to learn English as she is. It\\'s a tool she knows will help her, no matter what happens next. \"I\\'m about to face a new life,\" she explains, \"and I don\\'t know what\\'s coming.\"Ideal Rodriguez Rivas poses proudly with an American flag someone gave him shortly after he arrived in the United States.A new beginningOn a breezy spring evening just a day after he first stepped foot in the United States, Lorenzo stands stunned beneath the bright fluorescent lights of an El Paso strip mall.Heimer brought him to a beauty supply store here to buy him new shears -- ones that will close all the way.

In the 54th minute of Liverpool\\'s comfortable 5-0 win against Watford at Vicarage Road, Salah picked up the ball on the edge of the Watford box with a host of defenders between him and the goal. Using some delicate footwork and intricate trickery, Salah danced past a couple, faking a shot -- which left a player on the ground -- before curling home into the bottom corner to round off the outstanding goal. It comes in the game after the Egyptian\\'s excellent solo goal against Manchester City two weeks ago in which he jinked past multiple City defenders before firing his right-foot shot past goalkeeper Ederson.When asked whether he\\'s scored a better goal before, he said with a smile: \"Last game, maybe!\"Read More\"I don\\'t know which one is better, this one or the City one. Every time I\\'m in the box, I\\'m trying to give the ball to someone to score,\" he told BT Sport. His goal is his ninth in his last eight consecutive club games, and it is that form that has people suggesting he might be the favorite for this year\\'s Ballon d\\'Or award. And for leading sports scientist Simon Brundish, he believes Salah should be given the award. \"I think if he carries on like this, there\\'s no argument,\" Brundish said.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp agrees. \"His performance was massive today,\" the German manager told BT Sport afterward. \"The pass for the first goal was great and the second goal was special.

But right now, he is the best.\"Salah celebrates with teammates Trent Alexander-Arnold and Firmino after scoring against Watford.

Bowler Shami, the only Muslim player in India\\'s squad, was targeted with vitriolic social media abuse -- including Islamophobic messages -- by social media trolls who blamed him for India\\'s first ever loss to Pakistan in a T20 World Cup match on October 25.Indian captain Kohli vows to rectify mistakes after T20 World Cup loss to PakistanDespite hateful comments on Shami\\'s social media telling him to leave India and go to Pakistan, many Indian fans as well as national media outlet Zee News have claimed the hateful comments were posted by Pakistani bots with an anti-Indian agenda. Read MoreIndia\\'s captain was unequivocal in his support for Shami and firmly condemned the social media hate, saying he didn\\'t \"want to waste one minute\" on the trolls, whose \"lack of self-confidence\" and \"lack of compassion\" led them to target Shami. The comments came after calls for Kohli to speak out, with journalists Rana Ayyub and Barkha Dutt saying it was ironic for the team to take a knee for the Black Lives Matter movement but not condemn Islamophobia towards their own player.

In the aftermath of his brilliant two-shot victory at the 2021 PGA Championship on Sunday, there has been a groundswell of admiration for Mickelson from his fellow golfers and fans alike. From Tiger Woods to Justin Thomas, \"Lefty\" -- as he is affectionately nicknamed -- has been the recipient of heaps of praise on social media for the skill and resilience he showed in his record-breaking win. \"This is incredible. I feel like a true golf fan watching this,\" 2017 PGA Championship winner Thomas said on Twitter. \"What a cool moment for the sport.\"\"Golf is insane.

And it all paid dividends at Kiawah Island\\'s Ocean Course, as Mickelson became the oldest winner of a major tournament, finishing six-under for the competition. At age 50, Mickelson says the victory was particularly \"special\" because he was able to go against the prevailing belief that older athletes can\\'t crack it at the top. \"It\\'s special to do something of this level at this age when a lot of people don\\'t believe you can,\" the six-time major winner said afterward.\"It\\'s special to have people in my life from my wife, Amy, who without her love and support, I wouldn\\'t be here.

Fans actually managed to run ahead of him and Brooks Koepka, meaning they were engulfed in a throng of cheering supporters as they made their way onto the final green, such was the fervor around the prospect of a Mickelson win. On Monday, PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh apologized to both players for the moments when fans \"briefly overwhelmed security and made two players and their caddies feel vulnerable.\"Mickelson admitted the experience was daunting and uniquely memorable at the same time.Mickelson walks the 18th fairway before winning the 2021 PGA Championship.\"It\\'s pretty special because the environment that the fans bring is unique,\" he explained. \"I had an experience on 18 that I\\'ve never had in the game of golf, being engulfed by fans walking up 18.

And something I\\'ll cherish.\"Surrounded by all that excitement and with fans chanting his name throughout Sunday\\'s round, it might\\'ve been easy for Mickelson to lose his focus. But with some help from meditation techniques -- he\\'s learned to extend his focus and shut out the outside influences, something he said he\\'s worked on after a disappointing tournament a few weeks ago -- and the guiding hand of his brother Tim as his caddie, Mickelson was able to stay in the moment and concentrate on each shot appropriately.

In what was his first league start for Manchester United, the slight youngster scored two goals in a dramatic comeback against Sunderland -- his second a stunning left-foot volley. It was a special performance that got fans excited and hopeful that the club had unearthed yet another major talent in the game. For the player himself, it kick-started a promising breakthrough season for the then 18-year-old; Januzaj scored four league goals in 27 appearances in a side struggling for identity in the post-Alex Ferguson era. His good form, trickiness and eye for the spectacular were rewarded with a bumper five-year deal but things quickly began to change.

Loan spells at Borussia Dortmund and Sunderland did little to boost his reputation at the club, and he eventually was sold to Real Sociedad by then United manager Jose Mourinho in 2017. \"It\\'s a massive difference,\" Januzaj, 26, told CNN Sport when asked about the player he is today compared to the one who left the Premier League four years ago. \"In the past few years, I\\'ve learned so many things -- good things, bad things, everything.\"The good things, I keep doing. My talent will never, never disappear.\" READ: Ronaldo hits back at \\'lie\\' after France Football boss stokes Messi rivalryAdnan Januzaj scores Manchester United\\'s second goal against Sunderland in 2013.His move to Real Sociedad in Spain\\'s La Liga has helped Januzaj get his career back on track. As a pivotal player in the current side, the forward has helped Sociedad to a superb start to the season, with the club currently sitting third having led the league earlier in the year. He\\'s also made 13 appearances for the Belgian national team and, thanks to guidance from coaches at his new club, he\\'s learned to deal better with the mental side of the game. \\'I\\'ve never seen anything like that\\': Bizarre goal marks thrilling Manchester United and Arsenal clash\"When I was not playing a game, I was really nervous and just wanted to play,\" he said.\"Even if something goes wrong [...] you always have to try and stay stable. For a football player, it\\'s very important to stay stable in your head. \"It\\'s been a change in my head, when I\\'m not playing, I\\'m calm. If the manager needs me to come on and make the difference, I will come on and make the difference.\" Januzaj says he\\'s now loving life in Spain and thinks his game is better suited to the more technical style of play. \"Maybe God brought me here,\" he said, adding that he has more license to showcase his skills.  He also appreciates the unique position of being a player at Real Sociedad, a club dripping in history and nostalgia. Until the 1980s, only players from the Basque region could play for the team and, although that policy has since been dropped, the connection with the fans remains as strong as ever. \"You feel that, you can feel the colors, you feel the people, you feel that this is their dream,\" Januzaj added about playing in the region. \"If you\\'re from the team, you feel it because obviously from a young age, that\\'s the team that you loved.\"READ: Witsel on staying in football after retiring, extra training in China and the \\'amazing\\' HaalandJanuzaj celebrates scoring for Real Sociedad in November 2021. Performances again this season have demonstrated just how settled and comfortable Januzaj is at Sociedad, a place which has allowed him to thrive once more. He may not be the baby-faced trickster he once was -- he has just one goal in La Liga so far this season -- but he\\'s matured into a more reliable and consistent performer. He says things would be different if he were to ever move back to one of Europe\\'s biggest clubs but insists he is very happy where he currently is.It\\'s somewhat of a happy ending for the mercurial youngster who sacrificed a lot at an early age and who, at one point, looked to be sliding into football obscurity.  \"When I was 15-years-old, obviously I left my country, went to play in England and I sacrificed a lot,\" he said. \"I left everything in Belgium, the school, many things, my parents also, so it\\'s difficult. That\\'s a big sacrifice to make. \"At the end of the day, we work very hard and we have to. Sometimes in the morning, you wake up and you feel like, \\'Ahh, I have training,\\' but you have to do it.\"At just 26, Januzaj knows he has plenty more to offer in the game, and he\\'s now finally at a place which gives him the platform to perform.

Joe Exotic, into a limited series that dutifully replicates those events without much bite. The attention might still be welcome for streaming service Peacock, but after a poorly received docu-sequel, this cat appears to have exhausted most of its lives.The main selling point here, frankly, might be Kate McKinnon as Carole Baskin, the object of hostility that prompted Joe (\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\'s\" John Cameron Mitchell, blessed with a role where it\\'s impossible to overact) to try hiring a hitman to kill her, leading to his eventual conviction.Yet even the versatile \"Saturday Night Live\" star, somewhat miscast, can only do so much with this material. Thanks to the too-expansive eight-episode format, the producers have time to indulge in bizarre flights of fantasy in addition to filling in details of both Joe and Carole\\'s backstories, those of supporting players and the events that made them all famous or notorious, take your pick.\"He is a psychopath who wishes me dead,\" Carole notes near the outset, before one of many flashbacks explaining how things reached that acrimonious stage.Basically, the whole \"Tiger King\" saga turns out to be almost impossible to parody, which might explain in part why a much-ballyhooed project that was to have starred Nicolas Cage ultimately fizzled. Cage said at the time that the conclusion was the story had lost its relevance, which seems even truer now than it was then.Read MoreJohn Cameron Mitchell as \\'Joe Exotic\\' in Peacock\\'s \\'Joe vs. Carole\\' (Mark Taylor/Peacock).The bottom line is that you never really want to try telling a story like this after one of the principals has already hit the \"Dancing With the Stars\" stage of its life cycle.That\\'s not to say that some illuminating moments don\\'t emerge, such as Joe dealing with homophobia in his past, before announcing when he buys the land that became his big-cat park, \"No one\\'s gonna make me feel small again.\"As for Carole, the glimpses of her tumultuous first marriage humanize her a bit, while allowing the character to address her husband\\'s disappearance by saying, \"I don\\'t miss him, but I didn\\'t kill him.\" Meanwhile, she continues to provoke the easily riled Joe, despite advice from her husband Howard (Kyle MacLachlan) that engaging with him and his ilk amounts to \"swatting at flies.\"Adapted from a Wondery podcast, \"Joe vs Carole\" might actually provide its most memorable flourish in sequences that viewers won\\'t see, since the unfinished episodes made available for review feature dogs as stand-ins for the big cats, with a note that the lions and tigers will be added using computer-generated imagery.The dogs turn out to be very good boys and girls, patiently creating safe substitutes for the actors to play against. As for \"Joe vs Carole\" and the rest of those cool cats and kittens, while a limited series might have sounded like a swell idea back when the docuseries leapt into the zeitgeist, in March 2022, the timing is less than purr-fect.\"Joe vs Carole\" premieres March 3 on Peacock.',\n",

Gatherings are now limited to 10 people for those vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19, while households with unvaccinated people must not meet with more than two other people from one other household at a time.Some 500 people marched to the city center in the city of Bautzen, in Saxony, late into the night Monday in violation of public health regulations, some of them carrying anti-vaccination signs. Twelve police officers were injured and twelve emergency vehicles were damaged as protesters clashed with police. Scuffles broke out in several parts of the state, Saxony police said, while television footage showed demonstrators throwing objects and shouting insults at officers.Twenty-three people were criminally charged and another 183 were hit with less-serious administrative violations, police said. Read MoreProtesters scuffle with police officers during a demonstration in Bautzen on Monday.The protests in Germany come as Europe prepares for a surge in new coronavirus cases heading into the New Year holiday. While there remain pockets of communities opposed to Covid-19 vaccines and social distancing measures throughout the continent, anti-vaxxers have become increasingly violent in eastern Germany, which has been the scene of many protests and where the uptake of vaccines is lower than the national average in most states. Similar scenes of violence played out on Sunday in various places, including the Bavarian town of Schweinfurt, where hundreds of protesters also violated public health regulations to gather. Eight police were injured after being punched and kicked there, authorities said. A 27-year-old woman was criminally charged after she was accused of trying to break police cordon in the town with her 4-year-old child in tow, both of whom were pepper sprayed, authorities said. Murder plots and threats from anti-vaxxers pose challenge for Germany's new chancellorPoliticians and media outlets have reportedly received packages containing raw meat and threats from alleged anti-vaxxers, and, earlier this month, authorities uncovered a purported plot to assassinate Saxony Governor Michael Kretschmer. Kretschmer has been pushing for people in his state to get vaccinated and receive booster shots. Six people were arrested and questioned in relation to the allegations but later released.Germany's vaccination rate lags behind its neighbors in Western Europe, with 70.9% of the population having received both of their doses. Saxony's vaccination rate, at 63%, is the lowest of any German state. German health authorities have said that more people need to be vaccinated to protect the country from a new wave of cases driven by the increase of the Omicron variant across Europe during the holiday season. Germany earlier this month put in place a nationwide lockdown for unvaccinated people, banning them from accessing all but the most essential businesses. New Chancellor Olaf Scholz supports mandatory vaccinations and wants a law drafted that could be voted on by the parliament in late February. Parliament is due to meet in early January to begin discussions.

Germany's Constitutional Court also ruled that legislators need to set triage rules if intensive care units fill up with coronavirus patients. The German Intensive Care and Emergency has said that only one sixth of all ICU beds in the country are available.After reporting a record-breaking 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Christmas Day, France enacted a series of restrictions Monday limiting where people can eat, mandating more work from home options when possible, and curtailing the size of public gatherings. However, the government stopped short of putting in place curfews or lockdowns and will let local leaders to decide whether they need to implement outdoor mask mandates.Italy will close all nightclubs and bars in January, while Portugal closed schools, bars and clubs until January 10. Spanish authorities have reinstated a nationwide outdoor mask mandate and six northern regional governments have agreed to coordinate early closing hours for restaurants, bars and nightclubs -- a move affects 14 million people, about 29% of Spain's population. Madrid, however, will be one of Europe's few major cities to ring in the New Year with a large celebration. Barcelona and Valencia have canceled their fireworks displays in a bid to get people to stay at home.

Michael Flynn drew comparisons to Civil War battlefields and spoke of Americans who died for their country. Roger Stone called it a struggle \"between the godly and the godless, between good and evil.\" Rudy Giuliani called for \"trial by combat.\" Ali Alexander said it would be a \"knife fight.\" As 2020 faded into 2021, some of President Donald Trump\\'s most influential supporters -- among them members of his inner circle who were in direct contact with the President -- spoke in ominous and violent terms about what was coming on January 6. Even as anxious eyes turn toward the Inauguration Day on January 20, the words of these firebrands in the leadup to the riots at the Capitol raise crucial questions about the relationship between the rhetoric of far-right figureheads and the violence that unfolded on January 6. \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\" Bannon, Trump\\'s former top White House adviser, promised listeners of his podcast -- called \"War Room\" -- on January 5. The next day, Trump himself gave a rambling speech near the White House where he claimed the election \"was stolen from you, from me and from the country,\" and called on supporters to \"walk down to the Capitol.\"Read MoreIn this January 6, 2021 photo, supporters listen as President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Washington that preceded the deadly assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.\"We are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\" he added, \"and we are probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you will never take back our country with weakness.\" Soon after, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, killing a police officer and assaulting others before charging inside -- some carrying weapons and zip-tie handcuffs.\"What we have is influential, powerful people influencing the President and pushing out messages that are radicalizing large chunks of the population,\" said Heidi Beirich, chief strategy officer for the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit organization that monitors extremism around the world. \"It\\'s very dangerous.\" To be sure, as a rule most speech that doesn\\'t convey a direct threat or incite \"imminent lawless action\" is protected under the First Amendment.But experts told CNN they believe Trump and his most visible allies bear a great deal of responsibility for stoking the flames that led to the January 6 uprising. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When you are an adviser to a President, formal or informal, you need to think about the impact of anti-democratic rhetoric,\" said John Hudak, an expert on governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \"And the President himself, and a lot of the President\\'s supporters and certainly his children, seem to believe that it is responsible for a President and his advisers and family to be anti-democratic. That\\'s a real problem. And we haven\\'t really experienced that in our history.\"Trump has already paid a historic price for his words, with the US House on Wednesday voting to make him the only American president to have been impeached twice -- this time for \"incitement of insurrection.\" But while much attention has been paid to Trump\\'s words in the run up to the breach of the US Capitol, less talked about is the fiery rhetoric of his most high-profile champions.Bannon and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment. Stone rejected CNN\\'s questions as \"defamatory attempts to say that my belief in God and my view of the last election in apocalyptic terms is somehow inciting violence.\" Alexander argued he had \"no involvement in the breach of the US Capitol.\" Flynn attorney Sidney Powell, who herself is facing a defamation lawsuit over her claims about the election (she\\'s denied the allegations), insisted that Flynn \"encourages patriotism and lawful political action,\" and to suggest otherwise is \"absolutely ludicrous.\"Bannon\\'s menacing metaphorsFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon exits the Manhattan Federal Court on August 20, 2020 in the Manhattan borough of New York City. In the weeks between the election and that day, Bannon and his guests and co-hosts on his \"War Room\" podcast relentlessly promoted conspiracy theories of election fraud and cast the fight to overturn the election results in war-like and often apocalyptic terms.Bannon\\'s menacing metaphors first landed him in hot water a few days after on Election Day, when he suggested in a video that posted to several of his social media accounts that, if he were in charge, he wouldn\\'t merely fire FBI Director Christopher Wray and Anthony Fauci -- the US government\\'s top infectious disease expert -- but would put their heads on pikes \"as a warning to federal bureaucrats.\" Twitter permanently suspended his account.In December, Bannon\\'s co-host tweeted a video of Bannon speaking on \"War Room\" overlaid with cinematic music and dramatic images from the famous D-Day battle scene of \"Saving Private Ryan.\" In it, he spoke of the \"moral obligation\" Trump supporters have to \"the kids that died at Normandy.\" He added that if they allow Biden -- \"that feckless old man\" -- to win, \"I want you to explain that to the 20-year-old kid in the first wave on D-Day.\"JUST WATCHEDAvlon: Here\\'s a way to turn down the \\'MAGAphone\\'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAvlon: Here\\'s a way to turn down the \\'MAGAphone\\' 03:07On December 28, Bannon insisted that patriotic Trump supporters had to be ready to fight in the spirit of George Washington\\'s soldiers during the American Revolution and American soldiers on D-Day in World War II. \"That\\'s our DNA, that\\'s where we come from,\" Bannon said.Bannon began promoting the upcoming DC protests of January 6.  \"l\\'ll tell you this,\" Bannon said the day before the riot.  \"It\\'s not going to happen like you think it\\'s going to happen. OK, it\\'s going to be quite extraordinarily different. And all I can say is, strap in ... You have made this happen and tomorrow it\\'s game day. So strap in. Let\\'s get ready.\"The podcasts also pointed to close coordination with Trump\\'s team. \"You and me were talking almost every day, many times, you know, 10 times a day,\" Trump campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn said to Bannon on December 28.Meanwhile, a senior Trump adviser confirmed that the President and Bannon have been in communication in recent weeks, discussing Trump\\'s conspiracy theories about the election.\\'You either fight with us or you get slashed\\'Roger Stone, former adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, is flanked by security during a rally at Freedom Plaza, ahead of the U.S. Congress certification of the November 2020 election results, during protests in Washington, U.S., January 5, 2021. Just before Christmas, Alexander -- a political activist who has organized pro-Trump rallies, including one of the demonstrations that converged on the Capitol lawn on January 6 -- used violent metaphors to hint at what was to come in January when speaking to followers of his livestream channel on the social media platform Periscope. In his freewheeling monologue, Alexander credited Roger Stone, a veteran Republican operative and self-described \"dirty trickster\" whose 40-month prison sentence for seven felonies was cut short by Trump\\'s commutation in July. (He was given a full pardon in December). \"This is something Roger and I have been planning for a long time,\" Alexander said. \"And finally, he\\'s off the leash. So, you know, it\\'s a knife fight and your two knife fighters are Ali Alexander and Roger Stone, and you either fight with us or you get slashed. So I\\'ll let you guys know more about what that means as we evolve.\"  Alexander has helped turn the \"Stop the Steal\" slogan that Stone launched on Trump\\'s behalf during the 2016 primaries into a rallying cry for conservatives around the country.At a DC rally on the night of January 5, Stone took the stage clad in one of his trademark pinstripe suits as a dance track titled \"Roger Stone did nothing wrong\" blared from the speakers.JUST WATCHED15 hours of chaos that led to Trump\\'s impeachmentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH15 hours of chaos that led to Trump\\'s impeachment 04:47After repeating the falsehood that the election was stolen from Trump, Stone, 68, rallied the faithful with an us-versus-them battle cry. \"This is nothing less than an epic struggle for the future of this country between dark and light, between the godly and the godless, between good and evil,\" he said. \"And we will win this fight or America will step off into a thousand years of darkness. We dare not fail. I will be with you tomorrow shoulder to shoulder.\" Stone also has bumped elbows with extremist groups, most notably the Proud Boys. In September he endorsed the congressional candidacy of Nick Ochs, who founded the Hawaii chapter of the far-right organization. Ochs, whose bid for the US House came up short, was arrested for his role in the Capitol siege. Law enforcement was alerted to it by the photo Ochs posted on Twitter of himself enjoying a cigarette in the building, and by the comments he made to a CNN reporter. Long a dispenser of supercharged rhetoric, Stone was not muted by his recent run-in with the law, and was talking about election fraud even before November.In September, he went on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\\' show, InfoWars, and the two mused discursively about \"fake ballots,\" Big Tech and the Clintons.\"If someone will study the president\\'s authority in the Insurrection Act in his ability to impose, impose martial law,\" Stone said, \"if there is widespread cheating, he will have the authority to arrest (Mark) Zuckerberg, to arrest Tim Cook, to arrest the Clintons, to arrest anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal activity.\"War analogies aboundFormer US National Security Advisor Michael Flynn speaks to supporters of President Donald Trump during the Million MAGA March to protest the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in front of the US Supreme Court on December 12, 2020 in Washington, DC. For his part, Jones has joined \"Stop the Steal\" efforts since the November election and used inflammatory, dark rhetoric to bolster the movement\\'s false claims.Two days after election day, Jones said, \"We are in the attempted overthrow of our country.\" When a guest on the show mentioned people showing up in person to protest the counting of votes, Jones drew a comparison to World War II. \"It\\'s like when Hitler was bombing London, most Brits were against a war because they had World War I. But once Hitler bombed them, over 95% said let\\'s go to war,\" he said. \"This is a war. This is not regular times.\"Jones did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment.Also employing war analogies is another beneficiary of Trump\\'s pardon powers -- Michael T. Flynn, Trump\\'s former national security adviser.JUST WATCHEDFact Check: The lies that could define Trump\\'s legacyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFact Check: The lies that could define Trump\\'s legacy 04:09Speaking to a fired-up crowd at the DC rally on January 5, Flynn -- who was pardoned by Trump in November after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat -- managed to pack election-fraud conspiracy theories, violent innuendo and a call to action into a couple of sentences. \"In some of these states, we have more dead voters than are buried on the battlefields of Gettysburg, or the battlefields of Vicksburg, or the battlefields of Normandy,\" he said. \"Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don\\'t have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here, and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie.\"Much of the rhetoric leading up to the riot has been draped in the language of existential threat. Speaking at a January 6 rally just before the siege, Rudy Giuliani -- Trump\\'s personal attorney -- spoke in grandiose terms about the stakes at hand. \"This is bigger than Donald Trump,\" he said. \"It\\'s bigger than you and me. It\\'s about these monuments and what they stand for. This has been a year in which they have invaded our freedom of speech, our freedom of religion, our freedom to move, our freedom to live. I\\'ll be darned if they\\'re going to take away our free and fair vote. And we\\'re going to fight to the very end to make sure that doesn\\'t happen.\"His mention of \"trial by combat\" was cited by the New York State Bar Association, which has launched an inquiry into Giuliani to determine whether he should be expelled from the group.\"Mr. Giuliani\\'s words quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election\\'s outcome to take matters into their own hands,\" the group said in a statement. \"Their subsequent attack on the Capitol was nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power.\"Experts concerned that incitement is far from overJohn Scott-Railton, a researcher at University of Toronto\\'s Citizen Lab who now works with others to identify extremist groups who were part of the Capitol mob, said the rhetoric plays into the fantasies of armed protesters who have been gunning for a civil war.\"They\\'re ready -- it\\'s what they\\'ve been prancing around in the woods, playing dress up, preparing for,\" he said. \"I\\'m just terribly worried that they weren\\'t satisfied with what happened on the sixth, and they\\'re going to come back for more.\" As for Bannon, the tenor of his podcast took a turn once the violence started unfolding. On the morning of January 6, before the rally and march on the Capitol, Bannon echoed Stone\\'s words by saying the day would be a battle between \"the children of light and the forces of darkness.\" But the podcast\\'s tone shifted sharply as footage of the violence at the Capitol was broadcast nationwide. Even as Bannon and his co-podcasters continued to describe Vice President Mike Pence as a traitor, they absolved Trump and themselves from any responsibility for fomenting violence. \"What\\'s going on right now was choices made by individuals who are fed up with what they\\'ve seen happen,\" said right-wing activist Ben Bergquam on a War Room episode later that same day. \"When I\\'m talking to people on the ground, that is what I\\'m hearing over and over and over again, it has nothing to do with President Trump\\'s words.\" Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, said anyone paying attention knew the events on January 6 would be a magnet for angry people.

In a passionate essay published in The Players\\' Tribune this week, the 26-year-old addressed issues of racism in sport and society but stated he never went looking for this newfound attention. The unexpected spotlight comes after Wallace last month called for NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag. Just days later, NASCAR and the FBI launched an investigation after a crew member discovered what appeared to be a noose in Wallace\\'s garage at the Talladega Superspeedway.The FBI report \\u200blater found that the item had been in the team garage since last year and Wallace, therefore, was not a victim of a hate crime.Following the investigation, the 26-year-old has spoken out on racism and has subsequently received a backlash, which included President Donald Trump calling for the driver to apologize.

The cat later died of its injuries.\"The [Hendrix\\'s] owners discovered a trail of blood leading from the passageway to their home and then noticed a CCTV camera nearby. This had been set up by a neighbor whose own cat had suffered a similar fate, having been stabbed and killed a year before,\" Thompson said.\"We examined the footage and discovered that it had captured Bouquet stooping to stroke the cat before taking something from his rucksack and making a sudden jerk towards it.\"Thompson described it as a \"turning point\" in the police investigation.Two days later, on June 2, 2019, officers arrested the suspect and found a knife with cat DNA on the blade in his house.Thompson added that police found evidence on Bouquet\\'s computer that he had \"repeatedly\" visited a website about lost cats in the city and had viewed \"numerous\" videos of dogs killing cats.Cat owners fall in one of five categories, researchers say.

Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, another key papal ally embroiled in the sex abuse crisis, has also canceled his appearance at next week\\'s World Meeting of Families, a spokesman told CNN. Pennsylvania sex abuse report presents crucial test for Pope FrancisConsider the litany of recent incidents in the Catholic Church: • Catholic bishops have launched investigations into sexual misconduct in seminaries in Boston, Nebraska and Philadelphia.  • The former archbishop of Washington resigned from the College of Cardinals after accusations that he molested seminarians and an altar boy. Read More• A Catholic bishop in Australia was convicted by a civil court of covering up abuse, and the Vatican has accepted the resignations of six bishops from Latin America after church investigations. • An Associated Press investigation found evidence that priests and bishops around the world have abused Catholic nuns and sisters for decades. • Next week, the Pope plans to travel to Ireland, where the former president, in an interview with The Irish Times, recently accused a top Vatican official of pressuring her to \"protect\" incriminating church documents from civil authorities in 2003. The Vatican has declined to comment on the allegation. But none of the above compares to the stomach-turning, nearly 900-page grand jury report unveiled Tuesday in Pennsylvania. The report, two years in the making, revealed shocking accusations: More than 1,000 children had been abused by 300 Catholic \"predator priests\" in six Pennsylvania dioceses during the past 70 years. The report also said some church leaders covered up the crimes, shuffling priests from rehab centers to parishes, giving no notice to parents or civil authorities.  The state\\'s attorney general called it the largest investigation ever by a US government into the Catholic Church. The president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops called it a \"moral catastrophe.\"\"I know that many of you are asking,\" Cardinal Blase Cupich wrote to Catholics in his Chicago archdiocese Friday, \"how could this be happening again?\"Priest abuse victims detail lifetime of trauma and broken trustIf the Catholic sexual abuse scandal that came to light in 2002 slowly unspooled through news reports, Pennsylvania\\'s grand jury report landed like an atom bomb, dropping its online horrors all at once. With some redactions, the report was readily available for everyone to read and share: the accusations of sexual deviance, shameless lies and deceitful churchmen.\"What we have now is people freely expressing their outrage on Facebook and Twitter,\" said Greg Kandra, a Catholic deacon in Brooklyn, New York. \"The anger is palpable. This is like 2002 on steroids.\"The details in the grand jury report are so disturbing -- one section describes a gang of pedophile priests who marked their child victims with crucifixes -- that some Catholics said they now fear raising their children in the church. Many are also calling for bishops and other church leaders to be finally held accountable. All of the bishops and most of the priests named in the report escaped punishment. They were allowed to resign or quietly retire. Some were given recommendations for other jobs, including one at Disney World. Because of extensive coverups, the statute of limitations had run out on most of the crimes, the grand jury said. Only two priests were charged with crimes as a result of the investigation. \"The bishops\\' first reaction was to say that things look bad, but they did all we could,\" said Paula Kane, chair of Catholic Studies at the University of Pittsburgh.\"But lay people aren\\'t buying that. The trust between the church\\'s hierarchy and the people in the pews has been destroyed.\" This week, as the Catholic mood in the United States has shifted from shock and grief to outrage, an increasing number of Catholics are calling on the church to clean house, starting with the bishops. Report details sexual abuse by more than 300 priests in Pennsylvania\\'s Catholic ChurchFriday, Catholic theologians, scholars and lay leaders began circulating a petition urging all 271 active bishops in the United States to step down.As of Saturday, it had more than 1,000 signatures, representing a small fraction of the 68.5 million Catholics in the United States.\"Today, we call on the Catholic Bishops of the United States to prayerfully and genuinely consider submitting to Pope Francis their collective resignation as a public act of repentance and lamentation before God and God\\'s People,\" the petition said. Bishop-sized loophole After the 2002 Catholic sexual abuse scandal, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted new policies. They pledged to report priests accused of abuse promptly to police, include lay experts in abuse investigations and adopt \"safe environment\" training in their dioceses.  Catholic leaders say the policies have worked. \"By finding almost no cases after 2002, the grand jury\\'s conclusions are consistent with previous studies showing that Catholic Church reforms in the United States drastically reduced the incidence of clergy child abuse,\" Greg Burke, director of the Vatican\\'s press office, said Thursday. Burke also called the accusations in the grand jury report \"criminal and morally reprehensible.\" But some Catholics say the bishops\\' policies have a bishop-sized loophole, as evidenced by the case of Archbishop Theodore McCarrick. McCarrick, who resigned from the College of Cardinals on July 28, apparently rose to the top of the church\\'s ranks even though there were persistent rumors about his behavior with young men, including seminarians in his dioceses. McCarrick has denied the accusation about the altar boy and has not commented on the other allegations. Pope on Pennsylvania sex abuse report: \\'We abandoned the little ones\\'Two New Jersey dioceses where he was a bishop -- Metuchen and Newark -- have acknowledged paying settlements to men who accused McCarrick of abuse. The dioceses have refused to divulge the years of the settlements. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, announced Thursday that he will ask the Vatican to conduct an \"apostolic visitation,\" church-speak for an investigation, into McCarrick, and what church leaders knew about his behavior.  DiNardo also said the bishops\\' conference is working on a plan to make misconduct and abuse by bishops easier to report and resolve. Both of those steps would take approval from the Vatican. Under church law, only the Pope can discipline or remove bishops. Some Catholics say they are wary of bishops trying to police each other, saying such a system could be rife with conflicts of interest. \"I\\'m not so sure it should be up to the bishops to make recommendations or suggest solutions,\" said Kurt Martens, a canon law expert at The Catholic University of America in Washington. \"The credibility of the bishops is not that high,\" Martens said, \"and I am saying that charitably.\" What comes next? Next week, the Pope plans to travel to Ireland, a country that suffered through its own appalling clergy sex abuse scandal in 2009. He is widely expected to meet with victims, perhaps privately, and may also publicly address the Pennsylvania grand jury report in some way.American Catholics are increasingly skeptical of how the Pope is handling sex abuse in the church, according to the Pew Research Center. Less than half say he is doing a \"excellent\" or even \"good\" job on the issue, according to a survey taken in January, before the most recent scandals. Bishop says Catholic Church suffers from \\'crisis of sexual morality\\'Some say the recent scandals are cause for the church to rethink its stance on the all-male and mostly unmarried priesthood. (The Roman Catholic Church currently ordains married men in rare occasions.)   The Pope has said the \"door is closed\" on ordaining female priests, but has said he is open to discussing the possibility of married priests in places where there is a shortage of clergy. But the meeting to discuss that possibility won\\'t take place until October 2019. Many Catholics are looking for action now. In May, all of Chile\\'s 31 active bishops were called to Rome for an emergency summit after a Vatican investigator looked into a clergy sex abuse scandal in that country. All 31 offered their resignations, and the Vatican eventually accepted five of them.Experts say it would be impractical for all 271 of the active bishops in the United States to travel to Rome and meet with the Pope, and even more impractical to ask all of them to resign, though Francis could summon just the former and current bishops from Pennsylvania. It\\'s also possible that the Vatican quickly greenlights the US bishops\\' proposals to provide for greater oversight of bishops, even though that idea is often unpopular in Rome. (A papal proposal in 2015 for a church tribunal to judge bishops was quietly scotched.) For centuries, Catholic bishops have had near-total control in their dioceses, with little oversight from anyone save the Pope, said Kane, the Pittsburgh University scholar. \"That old model is still in place,\" she said. But the pressure is building on the bishops to change quickly.  Cardinal DiNardo, the president of the US Catholic bishops\\' conference, said he plans to travel to Rome to present his plan and \"urge further concrete steps based on them.\" Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington resigns after altar boy sex abuse allegationHe and other Catholic leaders say they don\\'t have much time to repair public trust in the church. \"The clock is ticking for all of us in church leadership,\" said Cardinal O\\'Malley of Boston, the Pope\\'s top adviser on sexual abuse. \"Catholics have lost patience with us and civil society has lost confidence in us.\"Meanwhile, officials in Pennsylvania said their investigation is not over. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro said his office\\'s hotline and email accounts for abuse survivors have \"lit up\" with more than 150 calls since the grand jury report was published. And some prominent Catholics, including Illinois State Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, are calling for attorneys general in more states to follow Pennsylvania\\'s lead.   \"That\\'s the only way I see something happening,\" she told National Catholic Reporter.

He later used his police belt to strangle and kill Everard, prosecutor Tom Little told the Old Bailey -- the central criminal court of England and Wales. Little summarized Couzens\\' actions as \"deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire.\" Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, went missing on the evening of March 3 after leaving a friend\\'s house in Clapham, south London. Her remains were found days later in woodland near Ashford, Kent -- more than 50 miles from where she was last seen.Couzens was later arrested at his home in Kent, close to where Everard\\'s body was found. Prosecutors said in July that Everard and Couzens \"were total strangers to each other\" before he abducted her from the roadside. On Wednesday, prosecutor Little said Couzens lured Everard into a rental car by falsely arresting her for Covid-19 violations, \"handcuffing her as well as showing her his warrant card.\"Read MoreLittle also detailed what eyewitnesses to the kidnapping saw, saying they observed Couzens handcuff Everard, who appeared compliant and had her head down. They thought he was an undercover police officer arresting a woman. Murder of young teacher makes women in London worry it could have been themEverard was alive for hours after her kidnapping, and was moved to Couzens\\' own car later that evening, the prosecutor said. \"In order to have done so and without her escaping or trying to escape or make a noise, it can be inferred that he, at least, must have threatened her,\" Little told the court.Prosecutors believe Everard died around 2.30 a.m. on March 4, several hours after she was kidnapped by Couzens. \"The defendant informed the psychiatrist that he strangled Sarah Everard using his belt. Given all the circumstances this would be consistent with his police belt,\" Little said.They believe this happened prior to 2.34 a.m., which was when Couzens went to a petrol station and \"bought two bottles of water, an apple juice, a Lucozade Orange and a carrier bag,\" Little said. \"There is no CCTV [video] from the petrol station at the relevant time due to a system upgrade having taken place. However the defendant was not to have known that and to have left her alive (even in the boot of the Seat) would have been foolhardy,\" Little said. Wayne Couzens seen in a handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police.Couzens burned Everard\\'s body in woodland in Kent, the court heard. \"He was to burn Sarah Everard\\'s body after he murdered her. He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task,\" Little said.A few days later, Couzens took his wife and two children on a trip to the same area. \"It follows that the defendant ... took his family on a family trip to the very woods where days earlier he had left Sarah Everard\\'s body, then returned to burn it and returned again to move it and hide it,\" Little said. The prosecutor also said that Couzens told his family that he was working on the night of March 3, when he kidnapped and subsequently murdered Everard.Wednesday\\'s emotional hearing saw Everard\\'s family speak in court, demanding that Couzens, who spent the hearing with his eyes closed and head bowed, look at them while they read their statements. Sarah\\'s mother, Susan, said her daughter \"spent the last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires ... He treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish. I am haunted by the horror of it.\"Kate Everard, Sarah\\'s sister, told the court: \"You used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in the car handcuffed for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? When did she realize that she wasn\\'t going to survive the night? I\\'m constantly replaying in my head. \"You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again ... My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn\\'t aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster,\" Kate added. Couzens is due to be sentenced on Thursday. He is expected to receive a mandatory life sentence, but the prosecution is seeking a whole life order, a term only granted in exceptional cases and under which there is no possibility of parole.Speaking to the court on Wednesday, Everard\\'s father, Jeremy, told Couzens that \"no punishment you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us.\" An epidemic of violenceEverard\\'s disappearance prompted an outpouring of grief and rage across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault, while also shining a light on the epidemic of violence against women and girls in the UK.One woman is killed by a man on average every three days in the UK, according to data from the Femicide Census, an organization that tracks violence against women and girls. The group argues that the government\\'s new strategy to curb such violence \"shamefully ignores\" victims of femicide.London\\'s Metropolitan Police force has faced a barrage of criticism for their actions in the days after Everard\\'s disappearance. The Met is also alleged to have failed to investigate multiple indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens, who was fired from the force in July, days after he pleaded guilty to the kidnap and rape of Everard. Women were reportedly warned by police officers not to venture out alone as they made door-to-door inquiries on the case, prompting some to comment that this approach only fueled the culture of victim blaming.The police\\'s rough handling of protesters at a vigil for Everard was met with anger. A March vigil for Everard dissolved into violence when a predominately-male cluster of officers attempted to disperse the crowd, who police say were in breach of Covid-19 regulations.  Meanwhile, the police regulator, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is investigating whether the police responded appropriately to a report that Couzens indecently exposed himself at a South London fast food restaurant in February. The IOPC is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate another indecent exposure incident linked to Couzens from 2015. Couzens joined the Met in September 2018 and was posted to a response team covering the Bromley area in southeast London. He then moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command in February 2020, where his \"primary role was on uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises, mainly a range of Embassies,\" a Met statement said.CNN\\'s Laura Smith-Spark, Kara Fox, Livvy Doherty and Schams Elwazer contributed to this report.

Erin Brymer, a Landstuhl Regional Medical Center registered nurse, told CNN at the United States\\' Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Monday.Brymer helped deliver the baby after the plane touched down at Ramstein on Saturday, following a flight from a staging base in the Middle East.The baby was one of three born during the evacuation from Afghanistan, according to US officials. The commander of US Transportation Command, Gen. Steve Lyons, told reporters at a news briefing Monday that two other babies were born at Ramstein. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday that the two other babies were born in a hospital shortly after the mothers\\' arrival to the base. \"Just an incredible, incredible operation ongoing, you know. Just impressive work by our great airmen,\" Lyons said. Read MoreThe flight was part of a chaotic scramble to airlift people out of Afghanistan. Ramstein is one of the largest US air bases outside America and has now been transformed into a temporary transit point for evacuees to the US.Capt. Erin Brymer told CNN how she helped deliver the baby.A total of 7,100 evacuees from Afghanistan have arrived at the base so far, the public affairs office at Ramstein Air Base told CNN on Monday. The base is nearing its capacity of 7,500, the office said, after 36 flights carrying evacuees landed in recent days.Brymer told CNN she\\'s delivered countless babies in hospital conditions, but this was her first \"in the wild.\"Afghan woman delivers baby aboard US evacuation aircraftShe said her team got notice a plane would be landing in 10 minutes with a mother who had gone into labor. When the team reached the plane the mother was crowning at the front of the aircraft, surrounded by a group of female evacuees holding up their shawls to protect her privacy. \"It was a beautiful sight to see,\" Brymer said.The team evaluated the patient and concluded they were \"past the point of no return,\" deciding to deliver the baby right there on the plane. \"That baby was going to be delivered before we could possibly transfer her to another facility,\" said Brymer.Brymer said she tried to reassure the woman by making eye contact with her and letting her know \"that everything is OK and that she can deliver this baby safely.\" The medical team told her \"we were ready for her when she was ready,\" Brymer added.The baby was delivered within 10-15 minutes of the aircraft touching down, said Brymer. As the delivery took place, the plane looked \"exactly like the photos you see\" from the evacuation flights -- packed with hundreds of people, Brymer added. First Afghan evacuees arrive in Germany in one of the largest airlift operations in historyAsked when she realized things would be OK for the baby and mother, Brymer said: \"When the baby came out screaming. And we were able to put her directly on mom\\'s chest and get her breastfeeding right away. I was like \\'OK, we\\'re good here.\\'\" The pilot mistakenly announced that the baby was a boy, and Brymer said she corrected him. \"I mean, it\\'s a girl,\" the pilot then said.For Brymer, the \"entire week has been a whirlwind of emotions,\" and the team continues to plan for other pregnant women who may require their assistance. \"I actually feel quite honored and humbled to be a part of this mission. And just kind of -- the sheer humanity of this,\" said Brymer. \"I mean, we\\'re people, they\\'re people. We both want the same things, healthy and strong mamas and babies.\"Kabul airport has been the epicenter of a desperate scramble for people trying to leave Afghanistan in recent days. On Monday, the number of evacuees inside the facility stood at about 13,000, most of whom are Afghans, a source familiar with the situation at the airport told CNN. The source said the numbers of US citizens at the airport was now in the low hundreds.CNN\\'s Sheena McKenzie, Oren Liebermann and David Gracey contributed to this report.',\n",

Tens of thousands of current and former NHS workers are being trained as vaccinators to support the what the health service has described as \"the biggest immunization program in its history.\"Brian William Pinker, 82, was the first person to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday morning. Read More\"I\\'m so pleased to be getting the [Covid-19] vaccine today,\" Pinker said after receiving his dose, according to the NHS England Twitter account. He added that he was considered a vulnerable person due to receiving dialysis. \"The vaccine means everything to me, to my mind it is the only way to get back to normal life,\" he said. UK emergency Covid-19 field hospitals asked to be \\'ready\\' to admit patients as crisis looms\"The very positive news this morning of the Oxford vaccine starting to be rolled out - that\\'s a triumph of British science that we\\'ve managed to get to where we are,\" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News on Monday.The rollout comes as coronavirus cases in the UK continue to surge. The country has registered over 50,000 new Covid-19 cases for six days in a row, with 54,990 new cases reported on Sunday.\"It is a very difficult situation in terms of the growth of the virus,\" Hancock said. \"But then we also have this very good news this morning, it\\'s a real pivotal moment with the arrival, actually in the hospitals of the UK, of the Oxford vaccine.\"The rollout comes after a shift in the UK\\'s immunization strategy. The government has said it will now prioritize giving the first in a series of two vaccine doses to as many people as possible, before administering a second dose up to 12 weeks later.This will apply to both the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which is already being administered.UK chief medical officers defend delay of second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine dosesThe British Medical Association (BMA), a body representing UK doctors, has criticized the move to postpone appointments for the very vulnerable patients currently awaiting their second shots.But the UK\\'s chief medical officers defended the change in strategy saying it was a move based on the \"balance of risks and benefits,\" and that the \"great majority\" of initial protection came from the first jab.The Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine also has the potential swiftly to protect millions more people around the world as and when other nations\\' regulators grant approval.AstraZeneca has promised to supply hundreds of millions of doses to low and middle-income countries, and to deliver the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis to those nations in perpetuity.The vaccine is significantly cheaper than others which have been approved and, crucially, it would be far easier to transport and distribute in developing countries than its rivals since it does not need to be stored at freezing temperatures.',\n",
       " 'Can a survivor find solace in return to scene of rape? - CNN A woman who survived a brutal gang rape at Florida State University returns to campus nearly three decades later to make peace with the past. rape, sexual assault, crime, colleges, students, campus, women, fraternities, athletes, universities, us, Can a survivor find solace in return to scene of rape? - CNN Ghosts of rape past: Can a survivor find solace in return to the crime scene? Tallahassee, Florida (CNN)On game day, 70,000 football fans pack Doak Campbell Stadium to watch Florida State roar to victory. I wait for the post-party quiet of the following morning to wander through campus with Maria, knowing that a return to this place could be risky.At the main entrance to the university, we run into two high school students from Tampa posing for a photo in garnet and gold Seminole jerseys. They want to enroll at FSU one day soon, they say, their cherubic faces lighting up. How this story was reportedThis narrative of a gang rape on the campus of Florida State University in 1988 was pieced together through hundreds of pages of documents and more than a dozen interviews.CNN reporter Moni Basu contacted the survivor of the rape through her former attorney, Dean LeBoeuf. Then Basu began a series of conversations with her that culminated in the survivor\\'s return to the FSU campus in Tallahassee for the first time since the attack 27 years ago. Basu interviewed the district attorney who oversaw the case and an assistant district attorney who prosecuted it; the attorney for defendant Daniel Oltarsh, a Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity member who served time for the rape; FSU professors; the lead police investigator; and the victim\\'s counselor. Basu requested an interview with Oltarsh but his lawyer did not respond to follow-up calls. She also reached out to a fraternity brother who cooperated with the police in exchange for immunity and to two other fraternity members who were indicted. The attempts to reach them were not successful.Basu also examined hundreds of pages of case files at the Leon County Courthouse in Tallahassee, including the grand jury report and the rape survivor\\'s deposition, as well as archival material at FSU\\'s Strozier Library.Maria was that way once: young and brimming with hope, excited to start the adult chapter of her life at a prominent state university bustling with students from all over the globe. In the fall of 1987, her mother dropped her off in this very spot, in front of the administrative offices housed in Westcott Building. But college turned out to be a dark adventure.Before she could finish her second semester, Maria was gang-raped on campus. Her assault made national headlines partly because the details read like sleazy fiction and partly because it involved one of the most prestigious fraternities on a football powerhouse campus. Read MoreIt was a case I became intimately aware of as a journalist in Tallahassee at the time and one that I sympathized with as a former FSU student and campus rape survivor.I expect the return to FSU to be a difficult journey -- for both Maria and me. It is the first trip back to campus for us since our departures from Tallahassee. In the years since, many things have changed at America\\'s institutions of higher learning. Sadly, some have not. Rape on college campuses was a serious problem then and remains one now. One in five college women said they were sexually assaulted, according to a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last June.It\\'s a problem highlighted in the film \"The Hunting Ground,\" which aired on CNN on November 22. The film delves into a connection between alcohol and sexual assault and explores a campus culture that protects perpetrators.It also focuses on the stories of survivors who became activists and took the issue all the way to the White House and prompted a federal investigation of the handling of sexual violence complaints on campuses.As the film demonstrates, the Internet and social media made it possible for rape survivors to connect with one another and find a modicum of comfort. Even power. When Maria and I were in college, that was not the case. We felt, and were, very much alone.We both chose to keep silent about what happened, except in Maria\\'s case, the crime was so heinous that despite her unwillingness, the state pursued charges against her rapists.Maria felt a thousand eyes on her. She bore the brunt of unkind comments. She came back to her dorm room one day to find this message on the white board on her door: Whore. She withdrew, rarely spoke about the incident and even tried to kill herself. She survived through the years, but only barely. A couple of months ago, Maria and I watched \"The Hunting Ground\" together.We sat at a desktop computer in a sterile hotel lobby, sharing a pair of earbuds. I used the left one and she, the right. It was the first time I\\'d met Maria in person, though I had spoken with her once on the phone a few weeks after her rape.Amid Spanish moss-draped oaks on FSU\\'s campus, Maria took stock of her painful history as a young student on this campusShe watched the movie intently. I could see tears gathering behind her glasses and her hands trembling. A few weeks later, she agreed to go back with me to the scene of her attack. After 27 years, she was ready, she said, to come to terms with the incident that altered her life\\'s trajectory.I understood all too well the significance of her decision. I, too, had only recently gone public about my rape after a reporting trip to my native India to find a woman named Mathura, a rape survivor who was at the heart of a groundbreaking case. I regretted that the newspaper stories I edited about Maria\\'s rape had never given her voice. Throughout her ordeal and the months of court proceedings, she chose to remain anonymous. She was never named publicly and granted only a handful of interviews. The court records were sealed to protect her identity.She agreed to speak with me on the condition that CNN not reveal her real name. She wanted to share her ordeal with other young women who have suffered rape or might be assaulted before they graduate. \"Maybe my story can help them in some way,\" she said.On this Sunday morning in October, a warm sun illuminates her golden hair as we meander down asphalt paths that connect FSU\\'s signature red brick buildings. I respect the courage it takes for her to stand with me on campus. A little after 9, her smartphone lights up with a text from her boyfriend: \"You\\'ve got this. I love you.\"Maria sighs. She came here, she tells me, to face the ghosts that haunt her. She wants to take her 18-year-old self by the hand, lead her through the places that were dark and let her know: \"It\\'s going to be alright. You are safe.\"A slideshow of chilling imagesFrom the main entrance of the university, we walk to a campus hangout where both Maria and I spent hours studying, the Sweet Shop. We take a break on Landis Green, the Central Park of FSU. Maria sits on a bench before live oaks laden with lacy Spanish moss that falls from the branches like tears. She hides her eyes behind Jackie O. sunglasses and takes slow drags of her Marlboro Menthol 100; I sense her anxiety as memories flood her mind.We decide to retrace the steps Maria took on a damp spring night in 1988, past the blocks that once housed a newspaper office where I worked and a JR market that sold Texas taters and $1.99 six-packs of Schaefer beer. We stand before an all-new Dorman Hall, tonier than the version where Maria lived. From her room, she could see a row of sorority houses that included Chi Omega, where a few years before Maria arrived at FSU serial killer Ted Bundy murdered two young women.We look the other way down Jefferson Street and recognize a motel-style apartment building with jalousie windows and air-conditioning units overworked even this far into autumn. We laugh that the ugliest building of all survived the bulldozers.Around the corner is the place where Maria went on her last night of normal. The Pi Kappa Alpha mansion with the stately white columns is no longer there, but Maria can picture it clearly in her mind. She points to the spot where she was tossed like a piece of trash, badly bruised and unconscious, just one drink away from death.There\\'s no clear storyline in her mind -- there wasn\\'t then and there isn\\'t now. She sees a slideshow of chilling images, blurry and yet so vivid at times that she can feel it all again.Wine, a blue room, cold tiles, running water, flesh. And force. So much force.Maria liked to drink and dance at an after-hours bottle club called the Late Night Library. On the evening of March 4, 1988, she was there with her friend Sandra. It was Friday, and the indie bar was hopping. Maria arrived at FSU shy and introverted. Her mother was an alcoholic, and Maria had started drinking in her senior year at a girls-only Catholic high school in Louisiana. At FSU, she rebelled. She thought alcohol helped her feel more comfortable, and she developed a penchant for partying and a reputation for being promiscuous. She had already had many beers by the time she ran into Daniel Oltarsh, a political science and economics major she\\'d met at a pig roast several months before. Oltarsh was handsome in a bookish way with blond curly locks and trendy round glasses that framed his blue eyes. Most of all, he was a Pike. At the time, Maria could not bear to look at the headlines about her rape. But friends saved newspaper clips for her to see later.Many of the men of Pi Kappa Alpha were well-heeled sons of prominent fathers. They wore starched Oxford shirts, double-breasted blue blazers and Rolex watches. Around campus, many considered them the kings of FSU\\'s Greek system, admired and reviled all at once.Maria felt honored that someone like Oltarsh would talk to her. So when he invited her to a party that night at the Pike mansion, she was beside herself. She walked back to her dorm, changed into a three-quarter sleeve sweater and black pencil skirt and poured herself a tumbler of tequila. She took the drink with her on the short walk to the fraternity house at 218 S. Wildwood Drive. Oltarsh was waiting for her on the columned porch. They went upstairs to his room. He managed to get a bottle of white wine and Maria drank more. It was past 3 in the morning.\"Where is the party?\" Maria asked.There was none.The details of what happened next are culled from court files, including police interviews with Pi Kappa Alpha members and a grand jury report indicting 23-year-old Oltarsh and two other fraternity members: Byron Stewart, then 21, and Jason McPharlin, 18, who was visiting from Auburn University.A fourth fraternity brother was given immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation. The documents include his version of what happened as well as a statement from McPharlin.  Maria was so drunk she could barely stand up. She told police Oltarsh got \"aggressive\" with her in his room and forced her to have sex. He then took her to the shared bathroom. He let other frat brothers know there was a girl available for sex. It was called \"pulling a train.\" Smoking helps calm Maria, who is recovering from years of post-traumatic stress, eating disorders and alcoholism. The fraternity brother who was given immunity told police that Oltarsh was fondling Maria in the shower and that he joined them there. He and Oltarsh took turns having sex with her in the shower. At some point, McPharlin went into the shower. He told prosecutors that he took his boxers off, got in the shower with Maria but did not have sexual intercourse with her. He got up and left after he saw Stewart, who he was not acquainted with at the time, come into the bathroom. Fraternity brothers who spoke to police said Stewart, a former high school football player from Orlando, could not get an erection and bragged about using a Colgate toothpaste tube to violate Maria. They called her obscene names and repeatedly told her she was in a house belonging to Sigma Chi, a rival fraternity. When they were done, they took her back to Oltarsh\\'s room and dressed her. Oltarsh used a ballpoint pen to write the words \"Hatchet Wound,\" crude slang for a woman\\'s genitals, on Maria\\'s right thigh. On the other, he scrawled the Greek letters of another fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon. Oltarsh and McPharlin carried her by the arms and legs to the Theta Chi fraternity house next door and left her limp body in the hallway, according to the fraternity brother who cooperated with the police. They left her there with her legs spread, her skirt pulled up and her underwear down.They then walked to the convenience store, the one that sold Texas taters, and Oltarsh used a pay phone to call the FSU police. He returned to his room on the third floor of the Pike house and watched from a window along with his accomplices as police officers and paramedics arrived at 5:30 in the morning. An ambulance sped Maria to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Her blood alcohol level was recorded at .349, three times the legal limit in Florida and one 4-ounce drink away from alcohol concentration that could have proved fatal.She spent most of the day in the hospital and was interviewed by a FSU police officer. Her recollection of her assault was not complete -- at some point, she blacked out from the alcohol. Medical examinations determined she had been sexually violated by more than one person. She had scratches and abrasions on her body.Later that day, she returned to Dorman Hall and stood in the shower, wanting desperately for the hot water to wash everything away.She just wanted to forget it ever happened. Only 20% of campus victims from the ages of 18 to 24 report their assaults to their institutions or law enforcement agencies, according to the Department of Justice.Maria did not want to press charges but District Attorney Willie Meggs did. The grand jury concluded Maria was physically helpless and was unable to resist and on May 18, 1988, Oltarsh and Stewart were indicted on a sexual battery charge. Oltarsh and McPharlin were charged with culpable negligence and kidnapping in connection with moving Maria. In addition, Oltarsh faced charges related to writing on Maria\\'s thighs and giving her alcohol as a minor. McPharlin was charged with possession of alcohol by a minor. The three maintained their innocence, saying that Maria was a willing participant.But Meggs felt Pi Kappa Alpha was covering up a crime.The indictments were largely based on the testimony of the fraternity brother who was given immunity and not charged in exchange. It was believed to be the first time members of a fraternity on a major university campus faced prosecution in a gang rape. Meggs understood the concept of fraternal loyalty from his service in the Marine Corps and years spent pounding Tallahassee pavements in his first beat as a cop. But he despised how the Pikes closed ranks around their own and had to be subpoenaed to answer questions.Maria crossed this intersection on the south side of campus on her way to the Pi Kappa Alpha house in 1988. She thought she would be attending a party. She was wrong.Even after all these years, Meggs gets emotional talking about Maria\\'s case. \"Their conduct was so egregious,\" he tells me. \"It was unconscionable.\"\"I was really disappointed that there wasn\\'t one red-blooded American in this fraternity who said: \\'Stop it.\\' That not one young man asked: \\'What if that was my sister?\\' \"It didn\\'t matter to Meggs, his assistant state attorneys who argued the case or the investigating police officers that Maria drank too much. Or that she was known as a party girl. She was not conscious enough to have consented that night. Even \"a prostitute can be raped,\" he says, if the sex act is not consensual.  And in Maria\\'s case, he says, she \"was in such a state that she could not say \\'no.\\'\"The state built its felony case against Oltarsh, who it determined was the instigator and ring leader. Photographs show the 23-year-old college junior appearing in court wearing jail garb and a smug smile. As the legal proceedings began, deep divisions surfaced on campus. I was editor of an independent newspaper called the Florida Flambeau that broke the news of Maria\\'s rape and covered every turn of the story. I understood her need for privacy but was bothered that we never heard her version of events. Letters to the editor attacked Maria as a liar, or someone who deserved what she got. Some called her unpatriotic for smearing the reputations of FSU\\'s upstanding young men.Maria couldn\\'t bear to watch television or read the newspapers. The women in her dorm stopped talking to her. She was afraid to walk out the door. She couldn\\'t wait until semester\\'s end when she could return home to Louisiana to spend the summer with her grandmother.  Maria found her hearty laugh as comforting as a good pot roast. Sometimes, her grandmother picked a gardenia from her garden and put it in a glass of water in Maria\\'s room so she would wake up to the sweet smell. She was the only person in her family to whom Maria confided what had happened.In the fall of 1988, Maria returned to FSU. She had a nose job, dyed her hair and exchanged her black clothes for pastels so she wouldn\\'t be instantly recognizable. She thought she could sit in her classes again as a sophomore. She thought she could reinvent herself. But when she came across the word \"whore\" scrawled on her memo board, everything went dark again. She popped over-the-counter sleeping pills, one after another. Luckily, she vomited them before they could kill her.Her parents arrived from Louisiana, packed up her belongings and took her home. She quit FSU and ended up in a halfway house in Texas, battling post-traumatic stress, depression, alcoholism and eating disorders -- typical of many college rape survivors. The rape set Maria on a downward spiral of shame, self-loathing, fear, anger. And more shame. In May 1990 Oltarsh\\'s lawyer, Craig Stella, served her a subpoena to return to Tallahassee for a deposition before a widely publicized trial.Tallahassee attorney Dean LeBoeuf sought to protect Maria during the legal proceedings. The case was groundbreaking, he says; a judge ruled defense lawyers could not interrogate Maria about her sexual history.\"It was a very hostile environment,\" recalls Stella. \"I had been practicing law for a while and it was one of the most difficult cases I had to defend. It was war.\"She sat in Room 314-E at the Leon County Courthouse, clutched a cushion to her chest and answered difficult questions. But prosecutors succeeded in persuading the judge to apply Florida\\'s rape shield law, then fairly new, to her deposition. The judge ruled defense lawyers could not use Maria\\'s sexual history against her.Attorney Dean LeBoeuf, who represented Maria throughout her ordeal, says as far as he knows, it was the first time the rape shield law was utilized in pre-trial testimony.Pi Kappa Alpha brothers in blue blazers packed the courtroom for Oltarsh\\'s trial. On the other side of the aisle sat a group of women who had decided they would appear there every day to support Maria. They were professors, students and women who worked in rape crisis centers; they wore little red ribbons to show solidarity. Many had written letters to Maria on the eve of her deposition. Patricia Martin, a professor of social work at FSU, was one of them.\"We are here for you,\" Martin wrote. \"I admire you -- only a person with strength and courage could hang in there, like you have done and are doing.\"The women\\'s letters were Maria\\'s \"lifeline\" and became rare treasures from that era. They were the closest thing she received to the kinds of messages of support women and girls can get these days when social media sites like Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat are used for the good.Maria\\'s therapist, who spoke to me with Maria\\'s permission, feels certain that Maria would not have felt as ostracized had her rape happened today.\"We have advanced tremendously in the last 30 years,\" says Dr. Tina Goodin. \"A lot of what was in the closet then is out today. And social media, when it is used well, changes things a lot. We see a sense of compassion and women asserting themselves.\"What rape survivors want, says Goodin, is to be validated in their experience; to know that what happened to them did not occur because they are crazy. In Maria\\'s case, the only comfort came from those letters she received from Martin and others.\"I knew she did not have any support,\" Martin says. \"Her so-called friends were siding with the boys.\"Martin is now retired but remains a researcher on campus rape. She published a widely-cited paper in 1989 on fraternities and sexual assault based on Maria\\'s case. \"I thought I was aware but I was so shocked by this case,\" Martin says. \"It was so unsavory -- every last bit of it.\"Campus safety had become a hot topic in the 1980s, but Martin says attention to the problem waned in the 1990s. \"Maybe we thought things were fixed.\"They aren\\'t. \"Alcohol, fraternities, an adoration for athletes,\" she says, \"are all important factors.\"In the end, Maria was spared the experience of having to look Oltarsh in the eye. Facing a life prison sentence, he accepted an 11th-hour plea deal. McPharlin pleaded no contest, had the charges reduced and was placed on probation for a year. Stewart got five years probation on his no-contest plea to sexual battery. Both were spared felony records. Oltarsh received a tougher sentence of 364 days in jail and 20 years of probation. After his release, Oltarsh violated the terms of his probation by possessing a firearm and failing to tell his probation officer of a change in employment. He was found guilty of sexual battery against Maria and resentenced in August 1992 to eight years in jail.  He was released in September 1995.After his initial sentencing, Oltarsh told reporters that he was convinced he would have been acquitted had all the evidence been laid out in court. He has never spoken publicly about Maria. Nor did he respond to a recent request for an interview made through Stella, his lawyer. Stella says his client took the plea deal unwillingly; Oltarsh does not believe he did anything wrong.District Attorney Willie Meggs pulled out boxes of files from the case against Daniel Oltarsh, the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity member who faced life in prison in Maria\\'s rape case. \"I was charged with defending a young man who very much wanted to put this behind him (and not) risk spending 20 years of his life in a penitentiary,\" Stella says. \"I do believe the facts of the case warranted a not guilty verdict. I thought that then and I believe that now.\"Was it incredibly poor taste?\" Stella asks. \"Yes, but not necessarily criminal.\" Oltarsh\\'s probationary period ended this year. He lives in Fort Lauderdale and can be found on the Florida sex offender registry.\\'I felt robbed\\'Maria had never seen her deposition until I took her to the Leon County Courthouse to meet with Meggs. I\\'d caught up with him a few days earlier in his fourth-floor office, surrounded by boxes of files he had pulled for us from a documents warehouse. He told me he liked to reconnect with crime victims in cases he prosecuted. \"I\\'m proud of you,\" he tells Maria. \"You didn\\'t want to go forward but we felt like we had to do this. I think you helped a lot of people in the long run. You were courageous.\"It is only in the last decade, after three failed marriages and the deaths of her mother and sister -- both alcohol related --  that Maria has begun to heal. She returned to college in Texas and in 2002 completed a master\\'s degree in psychology.\"I went back to school because I felt robbed. Robbed of my education, robbed of my typical student life, robbed of my aspirations, robbed of success,\" she says. \"Those guys took all that away from me. I showed them wrong.\"FSU took the significant step of suspending Pi Kappa Alpha as the investigation unfolded. The fraternity was banned from campus until its reinstatement in 2000. The Pikes own a new house about a mile east of their previous location. Last year, the fraternity was suspended again during another sexual battery investigation but the members were cleared.Maria knows she will never get an apology -- from her attackers or others who revictimized her with their actions. But she can get off the rollercoaster ride of recovery and relapses that has dominated her life. She has recovered from an anorexic weight of 91 pounds and has not touched alcohol in two years.\"For several years, I blocked it as though it happened to someone else just so I could move forward with my life,\" she says. \"I was trying to make myself disappear.\"Her words resonate. They are the same words I heard on the other side of the world, when I arrived at a remote village in India to speak with Mathura, a woman who was raped as a teenager by two police officers. They are the same words I use to describe my actions after being raped by a classmate.At the courthouse, we obtain a copy of Maria\\'s deposition and other case files. She gasps as she reads her own words all these years later.She tells me she is proud of 18-year-old Maria\\'s fortitude.Maria walked through the FSU campus clutching an amethyst geode. She hoped to find a sense of peace after revisiting the scene of the crime.Rape is \\'not the sum of me\\'For years, the old Pike house stood like an eye sore, boarded up and crumbling. For many, it was hard to drive by it without thinking about the rape.Maria and I stand on the street where the fraternity\\'s mansion once soared. In its place are new dorms built to match the Old English style of most other buildings on campus and nestled amid trees. It\\'s an idyllic setting, but Maria sees different images. They can\\'t be unseen.Maria is 46 now and works as a manager in an agency that oversees programs for people with disabilities. She couldn\\'t have stood again on this corner of the FSU campus any earlier in her life. She was not ready to face the past, she says, until now. She sees herself in all the young women who walk past us. It\\'s a different world with smart phones and emergency blue lights every few feet. But in many ways, it feels the same.\"I feel nervous for them,\" she says. She acknowledges that in most of her life, she turned to alcohol to cope with conflict, to numb her pain. And that it has taken all this time for her to shed her shame and say out loud that what happened to her on this street was not her fault. \"I didn\\'t deserve it.\"We both feel drained after our day on campus. It\\'s a good drained. \"I bear the scars,\" she says, \"but what happened to me here is not the sum of me.\"I look at Maria, her fingers wrapped around a Marlboro, and feel I have known her for a lifetime. I understand how the women in \"The Hunting Ground\" were able to connect in such profound ways. There is solace in shared experiences, I think to myself, even rape. It is as though I don\\'t have to say my thoughts out loud.We climb into my Mini Cooper in silence and drive down Jefferson Street, away from campus. Maria, I know, is finally leaving FSU.\"The Hunting Ground\" aired on CNN on Sunday, November 22, at 8 p.m. ET. The film was immediately followed by a special hosted by CNN\\'s Alisyn Camerota. Subjects of the film and critics alike discussed the issues the documentary raised and controversy surrounding sexual abuse allegations on college campuses across America.On December 1, 2015, \"The Hunting Ground\" was shortlisted for an Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)I am angry at the trajectory of our evolution as a species. I am angry at us, that we created a world where being a \"humanitarian\" is a \"thing\" and not the norm.The kindness of strangers exists. That I know. It\\'s literally the lifeblood of my charity the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance,  which facilitates medical care for war-wounded children who are unable to access the treatment they need. It\\'s in the army of volunteers who descended upon Beirut\\'s devastated neighborhoods and swept, cleaned, carried debris for days from the streets and inside people\\'s homes. It\\'s in those who choose not to charge rent during the Covid-19 pandemic; those who had businesses that they transformed into food delivery and mask-making entities; in the individual who does not walk past the beggar or homeless person on the street, but stops for them. It\\'s in those who World Humanitarian Day commemorates, aid workers killed or injured while trying to do right by those less fortunate, and those who continue to try to do so. And yet that is not the narrative of our human collective. For if it were, we would not be where we are today. We would be in a better place.There are those who are fighting every day to try to make even the smallest difference in the lives of people who have so little and who have been robbed of so much. I do not know a single humanitarian worker who is not utterly exhausted, and emotionally drained.I often ask myself: why is it so hard to do the right thing? Why are we humans so fundamentally flawed that selfishness, greed, hunger for power and disregard for others have become the predominant definers of our collective? For we are the cause of the biggest tragedies. We are the creators of greatest humanitarian crises. We are our own worst enemy. But we do have the power to change that.Read MoreI fundamentally believe that we can do better by each other -- because I see awe-inspiring courage in activists braving oppressive governments, I see inspiration among people who already have little giving to those who have even less, I see heartening solidarity in the wake of inexplicable disaster. Children gather at the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece. This photo is part of a collaboration between CNN and London\\'s Imperial War Museum, Life in a Camp, which launches next month.It takes something as incomprehensible and horrific as the Lebanon blast to capture the world\\'s attention, but even that is finite. Other crises have drifted from view. What of the nearly 80 million refugees around the world? From Bangladesh to South Sudan, to Myanmar, Syria and Somalia, the needs -- food, shelter, medicine, education, the chance to rebuild shattered lives and communities -- are more desperate than they have ever been. But they may as well exist on another planet.I was recently talking with one of my many wounded friends in Beirut, a psychoanalyst, about why cruelty towards one another exists on such a grand scale. \"Kindness is not as powerful as destruction.\" She said. \"Building something takes time, destruction takes seconds.\"Our conversation should not be dismissed as an emotional reaction to Beirut\\'s horrific blast or a by-product of my over-developed cynicism. We live in a world where, despite the connectivity -- the window into others\\' realities that social media has created -- it feels like we are growing increasingly immune to the suffering of others. We live in a world where we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on military might, yet if a fraction of that were diverted towards humanitarian aid, hunger might cease to exist.   The untold story of women who risked their lives to do good -- and get their rightsWhile governments do provide some funding, it\\'s far from enough, and too many are largely apathetic, energize a false sense of fear of \"the other\" and turn humanitarian aid into another pawn on the geopolitical chessboard. The knock-on effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the world\\'s many acute humanitarian crises has been profound. Funding has been diverted or dried up, aid budgets have been slashed, NGOs search desperately for ways to keep essential activities alive, state actors look the other way. According to the UN, \"In 2020, nearly 168 million people worldwide will need humanitarian assistance and protection,\" he said. \"That represents about one person in 45 on the planet. It is the highest figure in decades.\" And yet aid agencies have nowhere near enough funding to even begin addressing the scale of the need.The individual response to Covid-19, in many ways, epitomizes what we can become. It feels as if those of us who have soap, running water, the means to buy food, disinfectant and face masks have become more acutely aware of the plight of those who do not. It\\'s as if it created a freeze-frame moment of realization -- What if I had to face this in a refugee camp, a slum, a war zone? -- that led to inspiring stories across the globe of those who have transformed that moment into something bigger than themselves.We need to stop destroying each other and our planet. Our minds, our creativity have resulted in extraordinary things. There are amazing individuals, philanthropists and organizations trying to alter the current balance of our world. We need to focus on their missions. I do believe that if more of us work together we can succeed.

Marseille\\'s goalless draw with Galatasaray was halted for eight minutes in the closing stages of the first half following crowd violence and the throwing of projectiles.UEFA\\'s live match blog stated that the referee had paused the game due to \"security reasons related to pyrotechnics.\" Images showed lit flares being thrown between rival fans, with one hurled onto the pitch.Marseille and Galatasaray fans clash during the goalless draw.Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim, as well as respective club captains Fernando Muslera and Dimitri Payet, approached the area of the pitch closest to the warring fans in an attempt to de-escalate the trouble.

Nice were subsequently handed a two-point penalty and ordered to replay the match -- set to be played at a neutral venue behind closed doors. \\'We don\\'t want that reputation\\'Meanwhile, in London, West Ham\\'s well-earned 2-0 victory over Rapid Vienna was offset by similar scenes of crowd violence.Once again, images seemed to show multiple projectiles thrown between the home and away sections of the London Stadium -- including a water cooler.

Kathleen Rice became the 30th Democrat to announce plans to not seek re-election in 2022. By comparison, only 13 House Republicans are planning to call it quits or seek higher office.\"I entered public service 30 years ago and never left,\" said Rice of her decision. \"I have always believed that holding political office is neither a destiny nor a right. As elected officials, we must give all we have and then know when it is time to allow others to serve.\"The 30 House Democratic retirements are the most for the party since 1992, when a whopping 41(!) Democrats walked away from their seats. If one more House Democrat retires before the election, the 2022 cycle will tie the 1976 and 1978 election cycles as the second most retirements in modern history for the party, with 31. Democrats have already seen more retirements in this cycle than the last two elections combined. Amy Walter, the editor of the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign tip sheet, cites three main reasons for the Democratic exodus. First, she told me the national environment; \"it\\'s bad out there for Democrats,\" she said. Second, the weight of history; \"they all know that it\\'s hard for party in White House to pick up seats. They can only afford to lose 5. They can do math.\" And, finally the \"environment\" in the Capitol itself; \"Talk to any member or staffer and they\\'ll tell you morale is low. It\\'s a combination of January 6th, a lack of civility, plus a frustration with a fact that most legislation is leadership driven instead of member driven.\"Read More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a direct result of the malaise on Capitol Hill,\" said former New York Rep. Steve Israel, who previously ran the party\\'s House campaign committee. \"Most Members decide to retire when they calculate that they might lose their next election. These days people are deciding to retire when they\\'re confident they will win.\"Regardless of the reasons, the reality is that this rate of Democratic retirements begins to feed on itself at some point. If you are a Democratic member on the fence about running again and see a number of your colleagues deciding to end their political careers, that has to impact your own thinking. The more retirements there are, the easier it is for any one member to walk away. And that sort of snowball effect is what we\\'ve seen in recent weeks, with Democratic retirements coming hot and heavy.The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022And we know from history that open seats -- those without an incumbent running -- are more likely to flip parties than seats where the incumbent is seeking re-election.There is a solid -- if not perfect -- correlation between high retirement levels and House seat losses. In 1992, for example, Republicans netted 10 House seats in the general election, according to Brookings\\' Vital Statistics on Congress. In 1978, the Republican gain was 15. In 1976, however, Democrats actually gained a seat despite the 31 retirements from within their ranks.Democrats\\' issues are compounded by the fact that Republicans have kept their own retirements very low. If no other House Republican walks away this year, the 13 calling it quits will be the party\\'s lowest total since 1988. Add it up and you see LOTS of Democratic vulnerability and very little Republican danger.According to the Cook Political Report\\'s rankings, there are 38 competitive Democratic-held seats compared to just 19 Republican-held seats. With the House Democratic majority so thin, that disparity in competitive seats is a very ominous omen for Democrats\\' chances this fall.The simple fact is this: Democrats see the writing on the wall. Many are opting to retire rather than either lose a reelection bid or become a member of the minority party in the House in January 2023. And that is causing a vicious cycle that further narrows Democrats\\' chances this November.',\n",

Authorities believe the bus was carrying a total of 52 passengers, most of whom were tourists from North Macedonia, when the incident occurred at around 3 a.m. local time Tuesday.The bus, which had a North Macedonian registration, was traveling on the Struma highway west of the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The bus driver was among the dead, according to Bulgarian National Television (BNT).After initially reporting 46 deaths, authorities later said it was unclear whether 45 or 46 people had died, BNT reported.Authorities said seven people -- two women and five men -- who were traveling in the back of the bus survived by breaking the windows to escape. They have been taken to Pirogov emergency hospital in Sofia and are in stable condition.Read MoreAuthorities added that identification of the dead would be difficult as the bodies were severely damaged by the fire, BNT reported. Emergency services on the scene of the crash early Tuesday. Bulgarian Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov, who visited the crash site, told reporters he saw bodies \"clustered inside\" and \"burnt to ash.\" He said \"the picture is terrifying,\" adding \"I have never seen anything like this before.\" The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, Bulgarian officials said.Footage from Nova TV Bulgaria showed the charred remains of the bus on the side of the highway, with the mangled barrier wedged beneath the vehicle. Emergency responders were seen standing near fire trucks and a police van while an investigator in a white protective suit surveyed the scene taking photographs. Behind the vehicle, damage to the center divider was visible with debris strewn across both sides of the highway. Speaking alongside Rashkov, the director of Bulgaria\\'s National Investigation Service, Borislav Sarafov, called the incident \"a huge tragedy\" and offered his condolences to the families of the victims. Sarafov said the bus was one of four belonging to a tourist company from North Macedonia that entered Bulgaria late Monday from Turkey, BNT reported. The bus was returning to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, from Istanbul -- a journey of around 800 km (500 miles) -- when the accident occurred. At this stage in the investigation, Sarafov said officials were exploring two possible causes of the accident. \"One is a human error of the bus driver, the second is a sudden technical malfunction, which led to the accident,\" he said, according to BNT. BNT reported that Rashkov added: \"There is a guardrail here, which was simply taken away, which means that most likely for some reason the bus went to the right in the direction of travel and came into contact with the guardrail, which was simply destroyed.

His appearance came shortly before EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. europe, Russia: Alexey Navalny in court as EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell visits Moscow - CNN Kremlin critic Navalny in court as EU official makes controversial trip to Russia  Moscow (CNN)Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who was jailed this week over a years-old fraud case, denied wrongdoing during a court hearing Friday on separate charges that he defamed a World War Two veteran.Navalny accused prosecutors of a \"shameless\" pursuit of \"fabricated\" cases and said he did not understand the latest allegations against him, which relate to comments he made last June on social media. He had criticized a video by state media channel RT in which various people expressed support for controversial changes to the Russian constitution. Veteran Ignat Artemenko, 94, was among them.The activist\\'s appearance came shortly before EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.Europe talks the talk in criticizing Putin. Russia\\'s opposition is waiting for it to walk the walkBorrell, the EU\\'s high representative for foreign affairs, was among a number of EU leaders to condemn Russian authorities for imprisoning Navalny and for detaining thousands of people who protested his treatment.His decision to go ahead with the trip to Russia as planned -- despite the protests and continued imprisonment of Russia\\'s most prominent opposition figure -- with no pre-conditions has enraged critics of the EU\\'s relationship with Russia.Read More\"If the EU is serious about having a dialogue with Russia and not just with a group of thugs around Putin, then Borrell should have made meeting with Navalny a pre-condition,\" said Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russia-based opposition politician who has been poisoned twice in the past five years.Speaking alongside Lavrov, Borrell said he had called on Russia to release Navalny, who was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison, and to launch an investigation into his poisoning.A handout photo from the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry shows Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (left) and EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell during their meeting in Moscow on Friday.\"While we fully respect Russian sovereignty, and its own responsibility regarding the fulfillment of its international commitments, the European Union considers that issues related with the rule of law, human rights, civil society and political freedom are central to a common future, both for the European Union and Russia,\" Borrell said.He added that relations between the European Union and Russia have, over the past few years, \"been marked by fundamental differences and lack of trust.\"Lavrov in turn criticized sanctions on Moscow, saying that EU-Russia relations had gone through \"difficult times due to unilateral and illegitimate restrictions that the EU have imposed under false pretenses.\"He said it was important that Russia and EU \"showed the intent to support channels of dialogue, especially on those issues where we have diverging views.\" And he warned that \"the further deterioration of relations is fraught with negative consequences.\"Defamation claimNavalny\\'s defamation trial had been due to resume on January 20 but was postponed after his arrest at the airport on January 17, moments after he returned to Moscow from Germany. The opposition leader had been recovering in Berlin after falling ill on August 20 from exposure to military-grade Novichok on a plane heading from Siberia to Moscow. Navalny blames his poisoning on Russian security services and on President Vladimir Putin himself, accusations that the Kremlin has repeatedly denied. At the start of the hearing, Navalny asked the court for half an hour to get acquainted with the case and confer with his lawyers. The court said he had had since August to get acquainted with the case, to which Navalny replied: \"I had a lot of other stuff to do in August.\"The Kremlin\\'s crackdown on Alexey Navalny risks turning him into a martyrNavalny continued to ridicule the legal process and demand that the veteran, in his 90s, be permitted to take off his mask and lie down. The veteran appeared at the hearing via a video link from his apartment.Asked by the prosecutor if he understood the charges, Navalny replied \"No, I don\\'t know anything about Artemenko, except that his relatives are selling him out.\"Navalny is accused of breaking Russia\\'s libel law in his social media comments last June on the RT video, which also featured prominent Russian cultural and sporting figures. The changes to the constitution, which were backed in July 1 referendum, paved the way for Putin, who has ruled for two decades, to remain president until 2036. In December, the penalty for defamation was changed to include potential jail time. But at the time of the alleged offense, those found guilty could only be fined up to a million rubles (about $13,300) or ordered to carry out community service.Speaking Friday, Navalny accused Russian courts of being \"corrupt\" and claimed the case against him had been brought not by investigators but by \"the PR people of Russia Today (RT).\" The people who let Putin get away with persecuting Navalny\"Cases are always fabricated against me, but the authorities have problems when cases go to court,\" he said. \"It is clear to everyone there that the truth is on my side.\"Navalny was sentenced to prison on Tuesday for failing to report to parole officers following his poisoning last summer and thereby breaching the terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement in a 2014 case. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that that case was politically motivated.The Kremlin critic ridiculed claims he broke his parole conditions, pointing out that he was in a coma and then in ICU in Germany, and denounced President Vladimir Putin as \"Putin the poisoner.\"On Thursday it was revealed that a top doctor at the Russian hospital where Navalny was treated immediately after his poisoning last summer has died.Sergey Maximishin, who was the deputy chief physician of the Omsk emergency hospital, \"suddenly\" passed away at the age of 55, according to a statement released by the hospital.

The question is whether Smollett will clear the invisible bar set for him to make his way back onto screens big and small or end up on a list of uncastable actors. There are indications that at least some notable figures in Hollywood have not distanced himself from Smollett, who got his start in the industry at 12 years old in a short-lived ABC\\'s sitcom in which he starred alongside his siblings. At a hearing on Thursday, at which Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, Smollett\\'s team presented the judge with letters of support from actor Samuel L. Jackson and his wife LaTanya, among others. Read MoreIn their letter, the couple argued that Smollett should be spared jail time and that the 39-year-old \"has already suffered a great deal of punishment as this situation has destroyed his existing career and impuned his reputation.\" Smollett\\'s sister, Jurnee Smollett, arguably the most acclaimed of the family\\'s six entertainer siblings, remains well connected and regarded in the industry, as well. Even as the family navigated Jussie Smollett\\'s legal troubles, she was among the cast of HBO\\'s horror drama \"Lovecraft Country,\" which debuted in 2020. (CNN, like HBO, is owned by WarnerMedia.) It was on the press tour for that series that the actress, known for her past roles on shows like WGN\\'s \"Underground\" and HBO\\'s \"True Blood,\" publicly opened up about her brother\\'s scandal in detail and reiterated her support for him.Smollett was found guilty back in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime. The actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that in January 2019, two unknown men attacked him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime and at the time, celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly.  That support wavered as the incident\\'s twists and turns played out, particularly as investigators soon determined the actor orchestrated the incident and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama \"Empire\" to stage the incident for publicity.On Thursday, the silence from some of Smollett\\'s original defenders was deafening.Actress Yvette Nicole Brown was an exception. Among those who expressed her \"love\" for the Smollett family in 2019, Brown shared her thoughts once again on Friday, tweeting, \"The way that judge reprimanded Jussie, you\\'d think he murdered 2 people or used a gun instead of a taser on a Black man at a traffic stop.\" Smollett\\'s attorneys have indicated they intend to appeal.CNN\\'s Jason Kravarik and Brad Parks contributed to this report.',\n",

Here\\'s why - CNN Explainer: Australia\\'s nuclear-powered submarine deal is fueling anger in the country. Here\\'s why  (CNN)The US and UK will be sharing technology and expertise with Australia to help it build nuclear-powered submarines as part of a newly-announced defense pact between the three countries. The move has sparked fury in France, which has lost a long-standing agreement to supply Australia with diesel-powered subs.  But it\\'s not only the French who are furious. Anti-nuclear groups in Australia, and many citizens, are expressing anger over the deal, worried it may be a Trojan Horse for a nuclear power industry, which the nation has resisted for decades.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke personally to her Australian counterpart, Scott Morrison, to tell him the vessels would not be welcome in the waters of her country, which has been a no-nuclear zone since 1984.Six countries -- the UK, US, China, Russia, India and France -- already have nuclear-powered subs in their fleet, and many major developed economies, including the US and UK, use nuclear in their energy mix. In France, 70% of the country\\'s electricity is nuclear. So what\\'s all the fuss about? Here\\'s why some Australians are bothered by this deal.Read MoreHow is nuclear power made?Nuclear power is the world\\'s second-largest contributor of low-carbon electricity after hydropower, according to the International Energy Agency. It accounts for around 10 percent of the world\\'s electricity, generated by just over 440 power reactors.The power comes from a process known as nuclear fission, which involves the splitting of uranium atoms in a reactor that heats water to produce steam. This steam is used to spin turbines, which in turn produce electricity.Uranium pellets cool after passing through a furnace inside a nuclear plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan.Uranium is a heavy metal found in rocks and seabeds, and it\\'s a powerful element. One pellet of enriched uranium -- about the size of an eraser on the end of pencil -- contains the same energy as a ton of coal or three barrels of oil, according to GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy.While the process itself generates no emissions, greenhouse gases are generally emitted during the mining of uranium, and the enrichment process can be carbon intensive.Is nuclear renewable?The simple answer is \"no.\" The energy produced by nuclear power plants is in itself renewable, and the steam produced in nuclear reactors can be recycled and turned back into water to be used again in the nuclear fission process.The materials used in its production, however, are not renewable -- the metal is technically finite. But there is an argument that it can be used sustainably; the uranium resources across the world are so large that energy experts don\\'t foresee it running out.A grass fire burns at a uranium mine near Mt Brockman in the Kakadu National Park, Australia on September 1, 2004.Many groups that oppose nuclear power, however, do so because of the environmental destruction caused by uranium mining.Governments in many parts of the world are relying on nuclear energy to help decarbonize their economies. It is widely regarded as an efficient way of producing electricity, and depending on the energy used to mine and enrich the uranium, it could potentially be a zero-emissions power source. Beyond its low-carbon credentials, nuclear power is considered to have the highest capacity factor of any energy source, which means nuclear plants run at maximum power for more of the time than other types. In the US, they run at high capacity 92.5 percent of the time, government data shows. For coal, it\\'s around 40 percent, and wind is around 35 percent. Nuclear power can prevent millions of tons of emissions from entering the atmosphere each year, compared to fossil fuels.Sounds great. So why are so many Australians against it?It\\'s not just  Australia. Several countries have put the brakes on further development of the nuclear power industry since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant lost power in an earthquake and tsunami, which meant the cooling systems failed, leading to nuclear meltdowns and hydrogen explosions, sending harmful radiation into the atmosphere. Parts of the city remain off limits.It was the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, when a test that went wrong triggered an explosion and fire, releasing devastating amounts of radioactive material into the air. Thirty-one people were killed in the accident itself, while many more died from the effects of radiation exposure in the following years, with some estimates in the tens of thousands.An anti-uranium demonstration at the Sydney Opera House on June 04, 1979.But Australia\\'s anti-nuclear movement goes further back than that, to a strong protest movement in the 1970s. This emerged largely because of concerns around the environmental impacts of mining uranium -- which Australia has huge reserves of -- but also due to worries around risks to public health, particularly among communities living near proposed facilities. There are also concerns around how to safely store nuclear waste. Explosions or leaks of stored waste can impact human health too, though such disasters are far less common than they once were.In 1977, the Movement Against Uranium Mining in Australia collected 250,000 signatures for a moratorium on extracting the metal, even though nuclear power wasn\\'t being used in the country. But Australia still mines the metal today and exports it to generate nuclear power in other parts of the world. There is growing political pressure in Australia coming from leaders of the Liberals -- which is Australia\\'s conservative party -- to start using nuclear power. Without it, some argue, reaching net zero by 2030 will be impossible. It has resisted nuclear largely because it has had plentiful coal and gas reserves, but Australia is under pressure to wind down its use of fossil fuels. What are nuclear-powered submarines and how do they work? Australia\\'s firepower ambitions explained When announcing the new deal, Morrison said Australia was not seeking to develop \"civil nuclear capability,\" which would include nuclear power plants. But Greens Party leader Adam Bandt criticized the agreement in a tweet as putting \"floating Chernobyls in the heart of Australia\\'s cities,\" saying it \"makes Australia less safe.\"Bob Brown, a former Greens leader who campaigned against nuclear warships coming into Tasmania in the 1980s, told the Australian Financial Review on Thursday the deal put the country closer to developing a nuclear energy industry and warned of a backlash.\"I think it\\'s very cowardly what the government\\'s done,\" Brown said. \"It\\'s made a decision without reference to the public, knowing the public would oppose it.\"And what\\'s New Zealand\\'s stance?New Zealand is one of the few developed countries that does not have any nuclear reactors whatsoever. It also has a zero-nuclear zone which prevents nuclear weapons or nuclear ships from entering into its territory.  A nuclear power plant in Gundremmingen, Germany on February 26, 2021. Germany is reducing its use of nuclear power, while New Zealand still bans it entirely.In September 1978, the New Zealand government released a Royal Commission of inquiry into nuclear power, and a decision was made for the country to use its own resources to produce electricity, rather than implementing nuclear plants.Hydroelectric energy -- which harnesses energy from the movement of water --  now provides 80 percent of the country\\'s power, and investing in nuclear plants is still not considered to be cost effective. The initial cost of building nuclear power facilities is extremely high, according to the World Nuclear Association.However, the main reason for New Zealand\\'s opposition to nuclear power is -- as in Australia -- public opinion and concerns around safety and the disposal of nuclear waste.New Zealand\\'s anti-nuclear stance applies to nuclear power, nuclear-powered vessels, and nuclear weapons.CNN\\'s Angela Dewan contributed to this report.',\n",

Tangana and Argentinian singer Nathy Peluso filmed parts of the video for their track \"Ateo,\" meaning \"Atheist,\" at the 13th-century Toledo Cathedral, one of Spain\\'s most famous religious buildings. The video, released Thursday, shows C. Tangana and Peluso grinding against each other and dancing the bachata style in the cathedral and includes close-ups of the artwork featured on the cathedral\\'s walls. \"The Archbishop deeply regrets these events and condemns the scenes shot in the first church of the Archdiocese,\" a statement issued Friday by the Archdiocese on behalf of Archbishop Francisco Cerro Chaves said. \"We humbly and sincerely ask for forgiveness from all the lay faithful, the consecrated and the priests, who have felt rightly hurt by this improper use of a sacred place,\" the statement added.Read MoreThe song\\'s lyrics include a chorus of \"I was an atheist, but now I believe, because a miracle like you must have come down from heaven,\" while the first verse asks forgiveness from the Virgin of Almudena for \"what I do in your bed.\" Elsewhere in the video, a naked and partially pixelated Peluso is shown holding Tangana\\'s decapitated head, and at the end of the song, the two singers pose for a photo with priests and choirboys outside the cathedral.Tangana also pulls on Peluso\\'s hair in an echo of one of the paintings inside the cathedral, which shows a demon\\xa0pulling a woman\\'s hair to stop her reaching salvation at the Last Judgment. The painting is also used as the song\\'s artwork.While the Archbishop pledged to \"revise the procedures in place to avoid anything like this happening again,\" the Dean struck a very different note in a statement also issued Friday. Arguing the song \"tells the story of a conversion through human love,\" Dean Juan Miguel Ferrer Grenesche said the video\\'s final scenes where the singers pose for a photo showed the \"understanding and welcoming of the Church.\" Although he acknowledged the \"provocative visual language\" used, he defended the decision to allow filming in the cathedral, saying the \"sole purpose has been to boost dialogue with contemporary culture while preserving faith in the Church.\"Ferrer further said the song could \"do good for those distanced from the Church\" but apologized to those who had been hurt by it.As of Saturday, the music video had more than 2 million views on YouTube.

Dushman helped free prisoners from the notorious Nazi concentration camp as a soldier for the Soviet Red Army in World War II. The president of the local Jewish community, Charlotte Knobloch, called Dushman the \"Hero of Auschwitz\" and said in a statement that he saved \"countless lives.\"\"Every contemporary witness who passes away is a loss, but the farewell of David Dushman is particularly painful,\" she said. \"He was one of the last who could tell about this event from his own experience.\" Auschwitz-Birkenau, located in Nazi-occupied Poland, was the largest concentration camp run by Hitler\\'s regime.

But despite the harsh restrictions, case numbers are not dropping as fast as experts have hoped. Deaths continue to rise and public health experts and government are starting to warn people that the country will be in this battle for the long run.The new variant, known as B.1.1.7, has wreaked havoc in the UK, fueling a surge in cases towards the end of 2020 despite a national lockdown being in place. Data showing an uptick in cases in younger people suggests this was largely because schools had stayed open, enabling the variant to spread rapidly.London\\'s ICU nurses detail \\'diluted\\' care, depression and disaster during the UK\\'s deadly second waveThe UK is a cautionary tale of what could happen elsewhere. American public health experts are warning about a possible new surge in Covid-19 cases caused by the new strain first seen in southeast England. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that the new strain could become the predominant variant seen in the United States by March. According to Public Health England, the new strain first emerged in September. By late November, scientists started to raise concerns over the rising number of infections in Kent in the southeast. The region was an anomaly, because while cases were generally going down across the country due to national restrictions, they weren\\'t dropping in Kent. Read MoreBy December, the country\\'s leading epidemiologists were warning the new variant was outpacing the restrictions. It had by then spread to London where it was responsible for two-thirds of new cases. This forced the country into a much stricter lockdown from January 5 in which people were instructed to stay at home, households were banned from mixing -- indoors and outdoors -- and everything but essential stores closed, including most schools.For many experts, the decision came too late. \"It\\'s amazing that we seem to be making the same mistakes over and over again -- with increasing loss of life,\" Dr. Julian Tang, clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, noted in comments to the UK\\'s Science Media Centre.  But is the harsher strategy working? The evidence is mixed.Deadliest periodEngland reported nearly 70,000 new infections on January 4, the day before the new lockdown was announced. In terms of new cases reported, the country\\'s worst 10 days of the entire pandemic happened between December 29 and January 11, averaging over 55,000 new cases each day.Deaths soon followed: of the 11 deadliest days of the pandemic, 10 came between January 9 and 18. The country reported more than 1,000 deaths each day, something that has only happened once before. A few days after the new restrictions came into effect, the number of new cases began to gradually decline -- and have continued to since. The seven-day rolling average of new daily cases, a measure that smooths out anomalies such as lower testing at the weekends, dropped from the height of above 60,000 on January 1 to around 40,000 in recent days. However, it will likely take time for the impact to be felt in hospitals.\"We know there is a lag between reporting of new cases and any subsequent deaths,\" Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told CNN in an email. \"For example, a few percent of newly-diagnosed today may end up in hospital in around 7-14 days from now, and then approximately 1% of today\\'s cases will die in around 21-28 days\\' time,\" he added. The number of people who are hospitalized remains at a record high, with 38,000 people in hospitals.But while the latest figures might offer a glimpse of hope, other studies, including one by researchers at Imperial College London paints a contrasting picture. One study, called REACT-1, shows that coronavirus infections remained high in early January and stayed that way for the first 10 days of lockdown, which is the period covered by the study.Unlike the official case numbers, which are based on the number of people getting tested and thus may not include those who are asymptomatic or have not yet developed symptoms, the REACT-1 study tracks current coronavirus infections in the community and this time tested more than 140,000 randomly selected people.Covid variant found in UK may be more deadly than others, says Boris JohnsonSteven Riley, the author of the study and a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College, told CNN in an email that the figures do not show the kind of substantial decline that would be expected if the lockdown is strong enough to reduce the reproduction number -- the value indicates how much the virus is spreading: a reproduction rate of above 1 means the epidemic is growing. On Friday, the government said the number was between 0.8 and 1, although it cautioned this varied across the country.The study tested samples collected between January 6 and 15 and compared them to mobility data based on the GPS locations of individuals using the Facebook mobile phone app. The data shows a decrease in mobility at the end of December, followed by increase in early January when people returned to work, which the authors say may explain the higher number of people becoming infected in early January. Riley said that while the study did not show a big drop in infections, it wouldn\\'t be fair to say the lockdown is entirely failing. \"Our main point is that we did not detect a sharp decline which is what we really need to see.\"The authors further noted in the paper that, \"Until prevalence in the community is reduced substantially, health services will remain under extreme pressure and the cumulative number of lives lost during this pandemic will continue to increase rapidly.\"Reacting to the numbers, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures show the more contagious strain was spreading \"very fast indeed.\" \"I think it\\'s too early to say when we\\'ll be able to lift some of the restrictions,\" Johnson said.Pfizer\\'s Covid-19 vaccine appears to work against mutation in new coronavirus strains, study findsOn Friday, the government added another piece of bad news, saying there were some indications that the new strain of the virus could be more deadly. \"When we look at severity and mortality, data for patients who are in hospital with the virus suggest the outcomes for those with the original variant look the same as the new variant,\" said Patrick Vallance, the UK government\\'s chief scientific adviser. \"However, when looking at the data for people who have tested positive, there is an indication that the rate for the new variant is higher,\" he added. Vallance said the early data suggests that while roughly 10 of 1,000 infected men in their 60s would die of the old variant, this could rise to roughly 13 or 14 with the new strain.The government has also found itself under pressure to compensate people who need to self-isolate. A government-backed study published in September found that only 18% of people adhered to the self-isolation rules and suggested financial compensation might bring that number up.Full impact will take a whileWhile the numbers are debated and keep changing, health experts and politicians are asking the public for patience. The full impact of the lockdown won\\'t be felt for a while as it will take a long time -- and a lot more staying at home -- to get the latest surge fully under control, they believe. These coronavirus variants are keeping scientists awake at nightAccording to estimates by Head\\'s team, the number of people who succumb to the disease is likely to remain high and only start falling next month. And while hospital admissions are decreasing, the number of patients who are in hospital remains at record levels. Until the number of people discharged is higher than those admitted, the hospitals will remain at risk of running out of beds.\"The daily trend is showing the lockdown having an effect on those new daily cases,\" Head said. \"However, it is important to remember that impact on hospitalizations will only really be visible from trends starting around the last week of January, and deaths should be falling across February.\"For now, this all means strict restrictions will stay in place for some time.Top government officials have repeatedly said it is far too early to speculate about easing lockdown measures which are now scheduled to be in place until March, and possibly into the summer. \"It may well mean, for example, that any lockdown may have to be in place for longer than would have been the case with the old variant,\" Head said.',\n",

The suspect, who has not been named by police, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon and transported to the nearby city of Drammen.Police have not disclosed what charges the suspect is facing. Authorities released the latest statement to counter what they said was speculation on social media that other perpetrators were involved.The perpetrator is believed to have acted alone, police said.Speaking to media after the attack, Oyvind Aas, police chief of the county seat Drammen, said authorities had not ruled out the possibility of a terror attack. \"From the course of events, it is natural to consider whether this is an act of terrorism,\" he said. Read MoreHowever, Aas added, \"the apprehended person has not been questioned, and it is therefore too early to say anything about this and what was the person\\'s motivation.\"An unnamed man has been arrested.The suspect moved across a \"large area\" in the course of the attack and was apprehended at 6:47 p.m. local time, a police statement said. Speaking at a news conference in Oslo, the capital, Erna Solberg, the country\\'s outgoing Prime Minister, described the developments in Kongsberg as \"gruesome\" and promised \"all necessary resources\" were being deployed. \"The perpetrator has carried out horrific acts against several people. It is a very dramatic situation that has hit Kongsberg society hard, and the events shake us all,\" she said.The attack comes on the eve of a new government after last month\\'s parliamentary elections unseated the long-ruling Conservative Party. Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store is due to assume the role of Prime Minister on Thursday.In a Facebook post, Store described the attack as a \"cruel and brutal act.\" \"My thoughts and deepest sympathy now go to those affected, their families, and to the police, health personnel and aid workers who are now working full time to provide an overview and assist those who need help,\" he said.According to Aas, one of the injured is an off-duty policeman who was in a store.\"The injured have been taken to hospital for treatment. The Kongsberg municipality has been notified and has set up crisis teams to assist and follow up with those who need it,\" he said. Kongsberg is located 85 kilometers (about 53 miles) west of Oslo.Police in country are now temporarily armedLocal police began receiving emergency calls from central Kongsberg at 6:13 p.m. local time, according to a statement by the southeastern police district. The calls reported a person walking around with \"what was supposedly a bow and arrow.\" Shots were fired by police during the arrest, Aas said.\"It took some time from the time our first patrol was on the scene until he was arrested. We will return to a more detailed description of the course of events when we have a better overview of what happened,\" he said.Police across the country have now been given the rare order to carry firearms as a precaution.\"Due to the serious incident in Kongsberg where several people were killed and injured tonight, the police in Norway are temporarily armed,\" the Norwegian Police directorate said in a statement on Wednesday. \"This is an additional emergency measure,\" the statement added. \"The police currently have no concrete indications that there is a change in the threat level in the country.\"Under Norwegian law, officers typically must have prior approval to carry firearms.A far-right extremist killed 77 people in Norway. A decade on, \\'the hatred is still out there\\' but attacker\\'s influence is seen as lowThe attack comes just over a decade since Norway\\'s worst terrorist attack. In July 2011, Norwegian far-right extremist Anders Behring Brevik killed 77 people, many of them teenagers, in a bomb attack and gun rampage. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum possible term. In August 2019, another man stormed an Oslo mosque armed with guns before being overpowered.

Here\\'s how 4 countries are dealing with them  (CNN)Most European countries have Covid-19 vaccination rates that would be the envy of much of the world. But even here, hesitancy in certain areas is causing governments to take action -- or risk stalling their efforts to control the spread of the virus.The highly transmissible Delta variant and concerns that winter in the northern hemisphere could bring a bad flu season have increased the urgency for authorities to boost vaccine uptake.Reasons for hesitancy are varied. Some people believe they are fit, healthy and young, so getting vaccinated is not a priority. Some found it too complicated to book a vaccine so gave up. And some simply distrust their government to the extent that they\\'ve become susceptible to misinformation.So what are different governments doing to encourage those who have not been vaccinated, for whatever reason, to get the shot?Belgium: Unvaccinated urged to \\'examine their conscience\\'  Read MoreWhile 72% of Belgium\\'s population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, rates vary widely across the country of about 11.5 million people.In the capital, Brussels, only 51% of the total population is fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the country\\'s health authority, Sciensano. That compares with 79% for its Dutch-speaking Flanders region and 67% for French-speaking Wallonia.Authorities are now increasing pressure on vaccine holdouts in the capital in the hope of boosting vaccination rates.How Europe\\'s hospitals are faring in the face of another pandemic fallWhile restrictions such as the mandatory wearing of face masks indoors have been eased elsewhere in the country, they remain in place for Brussels because of its lower vaccination rate and the strain that Covid-19 cases are placing on the city\\'s hospitals.And from October 1, the regional government in Brussels will also require residents to show a \"Covid pass\" to prove that they have been vaccinated or have recently tested negative for the virus before they can enter restaurants, bars or fitness clubs, according to Reuters.This may go some way to encourage reluctant younger residents to get the shot. According to official figures, only 46% of those aged 18 to 24 in Brussels have received at least one vaccine dose, compared with 86% for the same age group in Flanders and 72% in Wallonia. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo had harsh words for the nation last Friday.\"Those who do not get vaccinated are responsible for the fact that stricter rules remain necessary in some places,\" he said. \"Intensive care is rapidly becoming a gathering place for the unvaccinated. We cannot accept that as a society. No one has the right to voluntarily put other people at risk.\"Nurses at major hospitals in Brussels wrote an open letter last week saying they were \"tired and angry\" at the continuing Covid-19 crisis and pleading with everyone to get vaccinated. Kenneth Coenye, chief medical officer at the Sint-Jan Clinic in Brussels, told CNN that during the last weekend of August, only four out of 70 patients being treated in Covid ICUs in the city were vaccinated. \"It\\'s very painful, of course, because they don\\'t only get sick, they die. And that is so completely preventable,\" he said.Speaking Saturday, the leader of Wallonia -- Belgium\\'s largest region -- urged citizens who have not yet received their Covid-19 vaccination \"to understand the consequences of their inaction and procrastination.\"\"We are not done with this damned virus because vaccination coverage remains insufficient,\" Minister-President Elio Di Rupo said. \"The unvaccinated bear a heavy responsibility for themselves, and those close to them. The time has therefore come for everyone to examine their conscience.\"France: Health pass boosts vaccine uptakeMeasures proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron this summer have had a marked impact on vaccine hesitancy.Late last year, polls showed barely 40% of the French expressed any intention of becoming vaccinated. But as of September 15, nearly 64% of the population was fully vaccinated and more than 73% had had at least one dose, according to figures from Our World in Data.Under legislation announced by Macron on July 12, people in France have since August been required to carry a Covid health pass, or \"pass sanitaire,\" to enter premises including bars, restaurants, cinemas and theaters, and many outdoor public spaces.The pass -- which shows proof of either vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or of past infection -- is also required for travel on long-distance public transport and to visit medical facilities.A Covid pass takes France by stormFrom September 30, children aged 12 and above will also have to comply with health pass rules. Workers in sites under the health pass mandate have themselves needed to be inoculated since August 30, and from October 15 this will also apply to health workers.Macron\\'s July 12 announcement prompted tens of thousands of protesters to take to the streets, calling for the government to scrap the new rules. However, it was also followed by an immediate spike in demand for vaccine appointments. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal hailed what he called a \"French success\" on Wednesday. \"We surpassed at the end of last week the threshold of 50 million vaccinated individuals and this number continues to rise,\" he said, adding that 14 million individuals had been incentivized to be vaccinated since July 12.But despite this, Attal warned that vigilance was still needed.Some areas, particularly in the south and east of the country, still have relatively lower Covid-19 vaccination rates, including the northern half of Corsica, where 59.7% of the population has received at least one dose, according to Ameli, France\\'s national health insurance body. The next lowest ranking are Seine-Saint-Denis, outside Paris, at 59.8%, Alpes de Haute Provence at 64.7% and Bouches-du-Rhône, home to the city of Marseille, where 64.9% of the population have received at least one dose.Demonstrators march in Marseille, southern France, during a national day of protest against the health pass mandated by the government in August.Meanwhile, figures for France\\'s overseas territories are significantly lower than for the mainland.\"In several territories -- notably Guyana, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia -- the situation remains extremely concerning and requires both the continuation of preventative measures and reinforcements,\" Attal said. Only 18.4% of the population in Guyana has received at least one vaccine dose, according to figures from Ameli.Some 587,000 people in France have already received a Covid-19 booster shot, Attal added. \"I implore the French citizens who have not been vaccinated to do so, just as I implore our elderly to resort to the booster option,\" he said.Italy: All workers will have to show a health passItaly\\'s government extended its mandatory health pass to all workers on September 16 in a bid to improve vaccine coverage. The measure is due to come into force on October 15.The country had already required all health workers to be vaccinated. And, since August 6, a \"certificazione verde,\" or green pass, has been needed to enter cultural sites such as museums or galleries, entertainment and sports venues, theme parks, spas, and to eat indoors. This was extended to include domestic flights, train travel between regions, as well as sea travel on September 1.The latest measure was introduced to \"make the vaccination campaign even stronger,\" said Health Minister Roberto Speranza.Italy to mandate Covid-19 \\'Green Pass\\' for all workersJust two days later, on September 18, the government commissioner in charge of the vaccination campaign recorded a countrywide increase in bookings of first Covid-19 vaccine doses of between 20% and 40%, compared to the previous week.According to government figures, over 76% of the population aged 12 and over is fully vaccinated, while around 82% has received at least one shot.But take-up still lags in some parts of Italy.According to the Gimbe Foundation, based on the data provided by the Health Ministry and the National Institute of Statistics, the areas with the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates are the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, in the South Tyrol Alps, and the regions of Calabria and Sicily, in the far south of the country.In Bolzano, 61.3% of the total population has had two doses, while the figure stands at 63.7% for Calabria and 62.7% for Sicily.People wait in a vaccination center on August 7 in Bari, southern Italy. Thomas Widmann, who heads the Bolzano health department, told CNN in a written message that a variety of factors contributed to South Tyrol\\'s lower vaccination rate.\"The hypotheses range from a greater propensity to homemade remedies, like medicinal herbs used in peasant tradition; there are those who assume a more marked anti-authoritarian tendency than elsewhere, for historical reasons; but I think more practical hypotheses should also be considered, such as logistical difficulties,\" he said.\"For those who live at the bottom of a mountain valley, going to a city vaccination center can mean wasting a lot of time.\"A vaccine bus service was launched in July to reach the more remote areas of South Tyrol.Meanwhile, Sicily\\'s regional president, Nello Musomeci, has made frequent appeals for its population to get vaccinated, describing it as a \"civic duty\" in a message to the island\\'s mayors last month. \"How unfair it would be to make everyone pay the hard price of those who do not want to get vaccinated!\" he said.Despite such exhortations, the announcement of the mandatory health pass for all workers led to an increase of only 5% in the number of people aged 20 and 59 booking vaccinations in Sicily in the week September 15-21.Germany: No more compensation for unvaccinated workers who lose payVaccinations in Germany are not compulsory. But authorities have been stepping up measures that make life increasingly inconvenient for people who remain unvaccinated against Covid-19.On Wednesday, the German Health Ministry announced new rules that mean unvaccinated workers will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if coronavirus measures forced them into quarantine.The new rules will come into force from November 1 and will affect people who test positive for Covid-19 and those returning from countries designated as \"high risk\" Covid-19 areas, Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters.Germans shocked by killing of cashier after Covid mask argumentThese countries currently include the United Kingdom, Turkey and parts of France, according to Germany\\'s public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Unvaccinated travelers from these \"high risk\" areas are required to quarantine for at least five days. Those who are fully vaccinated or have recently recovered from Covid-19 are not. Spahn defended the new rules, asking: \"Why should others pay for the fact that someone has decided not to be vaccinated?\" He stressed, however, that the new rules were a matter of fairness to everyone. \"Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around -- it is also a question of fairness,\" he said.The German trade union confederation (DGB) criticized the move, saying it dumped responsibility for the fight against the pandemic onto employees. \"We still reject mandatory vaccination through the back door,\" DGB chairman Reiner Hoffmann told Editor Network Germany.Germany\\'s Health Ministry had previously announced that Covid-19 tests, which the unvaccinated must undertake to be allowed to dine inside restaurants, for example, will stop being free of charge from October 11.A total of 63.6% of the German population had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of Thursday, according to the RKI -- under the 85% threshold deemed necessary by the RKI for herd immunity.CNN\\'s Joseph Ataman contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Why potassium iodide pills are suddenly in high demand  - CNN As Russia\\'s assault in Ukraine intensifies, fear of radioactive fallout from accidental or intentional attacks on Ukraine\\'s nuclear plants, or from the use of a nuclear bomb, has triggered surging demand for potassium iodide pills. business, Why potassium iodide pills are suddenly in high demand  - CNN Why potassium iodide pills are suddenly in high demand New York (CNNBusiness)As Russia\\'s assault in Ukraine intensifies, fear of radioactive fallout from accidental or intentional attacks on Ukraine\\'s nuclear plants, or from the use of a nuclear bomb, has triggered surging demand for potassium iodide pills.In such an event, there\\'s the frightening risk of large amounts of radioactive iodine (or radioiodine) being released into the atmosphere which can be breathed into lungs as well as contaminate water, soil, plants and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although potassium iodide itself isn\\'t harmful and is an important chemical that\\'s needed by the human body, the CDC says radioactive iodide can harm the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck that produces many of the hormones that regulate the body. The danger is that if radiation exposure occurs, the thyroid gland can\\'t distinguish between regular iodine and radioiodine and will absorb both. Too much exposure can lead to thyroid cancer. When used as directed, potassium iodide in liquid or pill form can quickly saturate the thyroid gland and prevent it from absorbing radioactive iodine. Read MorePrice gouging sets in Large manufacturers of potassium iodide approved for sale in the United Sates have seen their inventories rapidly depleted in recent weeks, coinciding with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.As supplies in the market dry up, price gouging has set in.On eBay (EBAY), four boxes of Thyrosafe potassium iodide tablets were listed for $132.50 on Monday. Another listing for a box of IOSAT 130 mg pills was selling for $89.95 each. The 14-pack box of the IOSAT tablets, made by Anbex, sell for $13.99 on the manufacturer\\'s website.Anbex is hoping to restock its inventory of IOSAT potassium Iodide tablets in the coming weeks.It\\'s also important to know that potassium iodide pills aren\\'t a cure-all and don\\'t offer 100% protection against radioactive iodine. The CDC warns that a single dose protects the thyroid gland for just 24 hours.The agency said taking a higher dose, or taking it more often than recommended, does not offer more protection and can cause severe illness or death.The CDC also cautions that potassium iodide pills only protect the thyroid and work best for certain age groups.Out of stockAnbex, Inc., based in New York, is a leading supplier and produces 65 mg and 130 mg IOSAT potassium iodide tablets. Its website currently shows a message saying, \"We are currently out of stock of IOSAT potassium iodide 130mg and 65mg tablets.\"\"We hope to be back in stock in early April but we\\'re pushing for late March,\" said Troy Jones, vice president of sales and marketing for Anbex. Jones also runs a website www.nukepills.com that sells Anbex\\'s potassium iodide pills.Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctionsJones said the company saw a rush of orders beginning in mid February of up to 15 million tablets from a variety of buyers, including individuals, resellers, hospitals, municipalities and governments worldwide.\"The big run started on February 23 through February 28. We sold out of all the inventory we had,\" Jones said. Although supplies are being replenished weekly, they\\'re selling out just as fast. \"In the past five days we\\'ve probably sold as much as what typically would take us half a year to sell,\" he added.The timeline, Jones said, matched reports last month that Russian forces had seized control of Ukraine\\'s Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The plant\\'s electrical system was reportedly damaged during the attack and required repair work.Russia could default on its debt within daysHistorically, demand for potassium iodide spikes when there\\'s a real or perceived threat of nuclear fallout, Jones said.Demand soared when former President Donald Trump tweeted in 2018 that he had a \"much bigger & more powerful\" button than North Korea\\'s Kim Jong-un, igniting fear about an escalating threat of nuclear war. It also happened in the same year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency sent out a false ballistic missile alert.And just last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he had ordered his country\\'s deterrence forces — which include nuclear arms — to be at their highest state of alert. The White House responded to the move, calling it part of a wider pattern of unprovoked escalations and \"manufactured threats\" from the Kremlin. The escalating rhetoric from Russia only helped fuel anxiety — and the purchase of potassium iodide, manufacturers said.Anbex, which sells its tablets in a 14- day or 20-day foil-sealed pack depending on the dosage, has ramped up production, said Jones. He said consumers should follow the CDC\\'s guidelines and only take potassium iodide pills on the advice of health officials.BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said demand for its Thyrosafe pills took off in February coinciding with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.London-based BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said it\\'s also experiencing heightened demand for the company\\'s potassium iodide products across Europe and the US.  \"This has coincided with the conflict in Ukraine,\" said Chris Sampson, spokesperson for London-based BTG, which also has US operations. BTG makes Thyrosafe, an FDA-appoved 65 mg over-the-counter potassium iodide tablet. A box of 20 tablets is priced at $12.95 on the company\\'s website.Sampson said BTG has not been entirely out of stock, \"though we have temporarily stopped accepting orders through our own website and some of our partners/distributors have been out of stock.\"\"Most of our product is sold to governments, public health agencies and the military who manage stockpiles,\" he said. \"All of those orders are being met.\" The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on this story.-- CNN\\'s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report',\n",

Not all of it was. - CNN From a glance at British media over the past few days, you could be forgiven for thinking that the entire United Kingdom is in a collective funk, distraught over the passing of Prince Philip and in a state of national mourning.   uk, Prince Philip death: Britain looked like it was in national mourning. Not all of it was. - CNN Britain looked like it was in national mourning after Prince Philip\\'s death. Not all of it was. London (CNN)From a glance at British media over the past few days, you could be forgiven for thinking that the entire United Kingdom is in a collective funk, distraught over the passing of Prince Philip and in a state of national mourning.  The reality is a little more nuanced. At the weekend, the BBC reported that it had received a significant number of complaints for its somber, wall-to-wall coverage of the Duke of Edinburgh\\'s death on not one but two TV channels and several radio stations, postponing popular programs like the final of cooking show MasterChef and the top-rated soap EastEnders in the process.  In situations like this, the national broadcaster is often stuck between a rock and a hard place. It has a duty not only to cover national events, but to focus the nation\\'s attention on them. Simultaneously, it is dealing with a public that consumes media in an increasingly fragmented way. Simply postponing shows rather than running them on different platform seems like an obvious answer, especially to younger viewers. It is a good example of how the world has changed around Queen Elizabeth II over the course of her almost 70-year rule, and her relationship with the public is far less clear-cut than it was at the time of the coronation in 1953.Read MoreIt is worth noting that Philip was credited with understanding the power and importance of the media and how it could be used to keep the Queen relevant. Perhaps most famously, he was behind the push to have her coronation televised, allowing the whole nation to share in the moment. A tribute to Philip is projected onto a large screen at Piccadilly Circus in London on Friday.The monarch still enjoys enormous personal popularity. Yet despite her efforts to be more accessible, it\\'s possible the public these days wants even more. Her younger relatives have for decades shown signs that they understand the demand for an even more open and accessible royal family.  \"Every time the public is asked who their favorite members of the family are excluding the Queen, it\\'s very often William and Kate who come out on top, overall, with Harry and Meghan still proving popular with younger people,\" said Joe Twyman, director of public opinion consultancy Deltapoll.  These four, of course, have been active campaigners for destigmatizing mental illness, combating climate change and have gone to great lengths to appear like normal people.  Before the recent troubles with Harry and Meghan, this multi-speed monarchy had actually served a useful purpose. Younger, approachable royals who made the institution less stuffy performed a role for the enormously popular Queen, trusted by the public to perform her constitutional duties with integrity. The golden years of this intergenerational tag-team were without question the early 2010s, when William and Kate\\'s marriage was celebrated with national street parties, and the Queen\\'s Diamond Jubilee in 2012.   This success, however, could be the catalyst for a series of tricky constitutional questions that will be asked when the Queen is no longer with us.  \"Philip\\'s death really is the beginning of the end of an era. It is a story that reminds us the Queen is a person, not just an institution,\" said Catherine Haddon, constitutional expert at the Institute for Government. \"The irony is that her younger relatives have to date been little more than personalities, and it\\'s not clear how well that will translate into becoming heads of the monarchy.\" Harry pays tribute to \\'cheeky\\' grandpa Prince Philip as he arrives in UK for funeral The person for whom this is most immediately problematic is Prince Charles, first in line to the throne.  Charles has an unenviable act to follow not just because of the Queen\\'s popularity, but because of the public image of him that has grown over his decades in the royal waiting room.  He\\'s been a climate change campaigner since before it was popular, interfered with government policy directly and, of course, was loathed by large chunks of the public after his divorce from Princess Diana.  The Queen, by contrast, was 25 when she was appointed to the throne on the death of her father.\"In a way, Charles is caught between two worlds. It\\'s not clear he will enjoy the deference his mother did because of his interventions with governments over the years, so traditional monarchists might not trust him to do the job with the same level of integrity. On the other hand, his personal brand has taken a sufficient hit that being more personal and accessible might not appeal in the same way as William and Kate,\" said Haddon.  Twyman said \"the public is used to having an opinion about Charles and Camilla, for better or for worse, in a way that it simply never has with the Queen. For the first time in centuries the monarch will have a personality beyond their public role. It\\'s very hard to predict what they will want from him, but it seems unlikely it will be a repeat of his mother\\'s leadership.\"  The public\\'s comparative support for William and Kate is stark. Countless opinion polls show that the public would rather skip a generation after the Queen\\'s death, placing William on the throne instead of his father. This is highly unlikely outside of a polling question. But the level of support for the younger couple suggests the public is comfortable with their public personalities being taken to the top of the institution.  The royal family\\'s traditional Christmas Day church service at  Sandringham on December 25, 2017.The contrast in affection for Charles and William could be a problem in itself. Charles is 72. If the Queen lives to the same age as her mother, Charles will take the throne at 79. If Charles lives as long as his father, William will not become King till 2048.  In that time, public sentiment towards the monarchy could change drastically again, especially if Charles\\'s popularity doesn\\'t go up after becoming King.  \"No one knows what Charles will be like as King yet. But the job has got harder since 1953 and will no doubt continue to get harder,\" said Ben Page, chief executive of polling company Ipsos MORI. \"The monarchy increasingly has to appeal to a more diverse country in everything from ethnicity and age to wealth. No product on earth is advertised to everyone aged zero to 100, or penniless to millionaires.\"  In a short period of time, an institution averse to radical change will be forced to assess its next steps. Total continuity from Queen Elizabeth is already impossible, given the public roles her successors currently have.  And, as Twyman points out, these conversations \"will take place in the context of the first coronation in most people\\'s lives of an elderly king who many already have strong opinions on.\"  The complaints over the BBC\\'s coverage, it\\'s important to note, were probably not out of disrespect to the Queen or her late husband, but a younger generation\\'s bemusement at coverage that seemed to belong in a different era.   \"The idea that institutions like the BBC and the government go into days of mourning and a public-facing role of obeyance clearly confuses a lot of people,\" said Haddon. \"And the fact we\\'ve been hearing personal recollections from members of the family suggest they probably know this.\"  It\\'s hardly a stretch of the imagination, given how much the world has changed, to understand that the public\\'s relationship with the royal family is not the same as it was seven decades ago. It stands to reason that the British public will want something new when the time comes for Charles to become King.  The unanswerable question for now is if the monarchy -- and the institutions that surround it -- are sufficiently prepared to modernize beyond the baby steps of recent years once the boss, whose leadership has barely changed since her coronation all those years ago, is no longer around.

The new wall, which would include a system of motion sensors and cameras, would further bolster border security.Record number of people attempt to cross the border between Poland and Belarus, officials sayPoland and fellow EU countries Lithuania and Latvia have reported sharp increases in migrants from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq crossing their borders from Belarus, in what Warsaw and Brussels say is a form of hybrid warfare designed to put pressure on the EU over sanctions against Minsk.\"Despite the fact that the Polish-Belarusian section of the state border has been set up with barbed wire and a concertina-type wire fence, the number of attempts to cross the border is not decreasing, but is growing,\" said the justification of the bill posted on the parliament\\'s website.Read MoreFrom the start of January till the end of September, it said, the Border Guard prevented 9,287 attempts to cross the frontier from Belarus into Poland, and of those around 8,000 took place in the last two months alone.Transcript: CNN interview with Belarus leader Alexander LukashenkoIn Germany, the federal police said Wednesday that the number of people entering the country after following the Belarus-Poland route had risen above 4,300 since August -- against just 26 registered in the period from January to July.\"There are currently no signs of an easing of the situation on the German-Polish border,\" the police said, adding that they had stepped up internal border searches and reintroduced temporary frontier controls.A spokesperson for Germany\\'s interior ministry said further measures to halt illegal migration were under consideration.The new influx is prompting comparisons to the 2015 migrant crisis, when more than 1 million people reached Europe via Greece and the Balkan route, fleeing wars, persecution and poverty in the Middle East and beyond.

On each gurney lay a body inside a black plastic bag.   europe, As Romania struggles with Covid fourth wave bodies pile up outside hospital morgue  - CNN Bodies pile up outside hospital morgue as Romania struggles with fourth wave of Covid Bucharest, Romania (CNN)\"It\\'s relentless -- relentless,\" sighed nurse Claudiu Ionita, standing in front of a line of gurneys in Bucharest University Hospital\\'s morgue. On each gurney lay a body inside a black plastic bag.  The morgue has a capacity for 15 bodies, but on the day CNN visited, it had received 41. The excess bodies filled the corridor outside, while wails echoed from within the morgue. A woman had been allowed inside for a final glimpse of her father.  Bucharest University Hospital is the Romanian capital\\'s largest medical facility treating Covid-19 patients and is struggling through the country\\'s fourth wave, its worst yet.     \"I never thought, when I started this job, that I would live through something like this,\" said Ionita. \"I never thought such a catastrophe could happen, that we\\'d end up sending whole families to their graves.\" Europe is learning a crucial lesson -- vaccines work, but they alone won\\'t stop Covid nowSeveral floors above, all the beds but one in the hospital\\'s now-expanded intensive care units were full. A nurse was changing the sheets on the one vacant bed -- empty, because the person who occupied it now lay in the morgue. Read MoreRomania has one of Europe\\'s lowest vaccination rates. Just under 36% of the population has been vaccinated, even though the country\\'s vaccination campaign got off to a good start last December.  Medical workers and officials attribute this low vaccination rate to a variety of factors, including suspicion of the authorities, deeply held religious beliefs, and a flood of misinformation surging through social media.  Dr. Alexandra Munteanu, pictured at the Palatul Copiilor vaccination center in Bucharest on November 16, is ready to vaccinate as many people as needed -- if only they would come.When Dr. Alexandra Munteanu, 32, arrived for duty at one of Bucharest\\'s vaccination centers after an overnight shift in hospital, she found turnout was low. She\\'s perplexed that the gravity of the disease just doesn\\'t seem to have sunk in. \"There are lots of doctors, myself included, who work with Covid patients, and we are trying to tell people this disease actually exists,\" she said.   One of the country\\'s most vocal and high-profile anti-vaxxers is Diana Sosoaca, a member of the Romanian Senate. In one of her many public stunts she tried to block people from entering a vaccine center in her constituency in the northeast of the country.  \"If you love your children, stop the vaccinations,\" she says in a video clip on her Facebook page. \"Don\\'t kill them!\"  The most important way of stopping another Covid surgeThe vaccines on offer in Romania have been extensively tested for use in children and have proven to be safe and effective, but that hasn\\'t stopped her and others from spreading wild rumors on social media and local television.     Officials and medical personnel are exasperated that public figures have done so much to undermine their efforts.  \"Look at the reality,\" said Col. Dr. Valeriu Gheorghita, an army doctor who runs the national vaccination campaign. \"We have our intensive care units full of patients. We have lots of new cases. We have, unfortunately, hundreds of deaths every day. So this is the reality. And more than 90% of patients who died were unvaccinated.\"  A banner in Bucharest shows medics working on Covid-19 patients with this message: \"They\\'re suffocating. They\\'re begging us. They\\'re regretting.\"In Bucharest, a huge banner has gone up, covering half the façade of a building on a major boulevard. \"They\\'re suffocating. They\\'re begging us. They\\'re regretting,\" are the words printed in massive black letters above black-and-white photographs of medics struggling over Covid patients in an intensive care unit.  Down below, few passers-by glance up at the poster, and even fewer cared to share their thoughts with CNN. Soon, however, that banner will go up in other major cities in the country.   \"There\\'s manipulation,\" said a woman who gave her name only as Claudia, adding: \"Some people don\\'t believe in the vaccines.\" Mayor: \\'It\\'s not a safe vaccine\\'Nowhere is that suspicion more apparent than in the countryside, where Covid-19 vaccination rates plummet to about half of those in urban areas.   Suceava County, an hour\\'s flight northeast of Bucharest, has the lowest overall vaccination rate in the country.   Here, the manager of the main hospital, Dr. Alexandru Calancea, 40, talks about the particularity of this region, where he was born and bred.   Austria announces Europe\\'s first nationwide vaccine mandate and reimposes lockdown as Covid-19 soars \"This county is very religious. This is an area that has a strong religious tradition, and a lot of religious people. [...] Very few [priests] are pro-vaccine, and I definitely know some who are anti-vax. Most of them choose not to say anything, either for or against. We have proof, from the hospital, from patients who come from the same religious communities, where their priest, or their pastor, has advised them to not get vaccinated, just like that.\"  Just outside Suceava, in the village of Bosanci, such a pastor also serves as the village mayor. Neculai Miron has been one of the most vocal anti-vax public figures in the country, and today is no different. \"We\\'re not against vaccination, but we want to verify it, to satisfy our worries, because there have been many side effects,\" he told CNN. \"We don\\'t think that the vaccine components are very safe. It\\'s not a safe vaccine.\"  Neculai Miron, mayor of the village of Bosanci, in Suceava County, is vocal about his views against the vaccine -- he thinks it\\'s not safe.The medical data doesn\\'t sway him, and neither does the local GP, whom he took the CNN team to see.   Dr. Daniela Afadaroaie administers the vaccine to about 10 people every other day, using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The latest official records show that just under 11% of the village was vaccinated as of early November 2021. While she talked about the situation in the village, the mayor, Miron, hovered around the doctor\\'s desk, peering down at the papers on her desk to see who had been vaccinated.  \"When are you going to get vaccinated, Mr. Mayor?\" asked Afadaroaie, laughing.   \"I don\\'t need to get vaccinated,\" he shot back. \"I\\'m perfectly healthy.\" The doctor\\'s explanation that the vaccine helps keep you that way fell on deaf ears.   Pastor: \\'I believe what I see, rather than what I hear\\'In rural villages like this, poverty and lack of education, together with local leaders\\' personal influence and traditional religious beliefs, can make for a deadly combination. But the local Pentecostal pastor, Dragos Croitoru, insisted he was unaware of any deaths from Covid-19 in the parish. \"Here in the church, we don\\'t have any cases of people who are sick with coronavirus. We have a zero percent mortality rate, I don\\'t know anyone who\\'s died of coronavirus here in our parish. And I believe what I see, rather than what I hear,\" he said.   Despite hearing from CNN about the bodies of Covid-19 victims filling the morgue at Bucharest University Hospital, Croitoru was unconvinced. \"Bucharest is bigger than Bosanci, as far as I know,\" he chuckled. \"We haven\\'t had any dead. Maybe we\\'ve had a few people who have been ill in the village, yes, as far as I know, yes. But the mortality rate in our church has been zero.\"    The mortality rate is certainly high elsewhere in this mostly rural county. Suceava ranked third highest in Covid-19 mortality rates for the whole country as of early November, according to figures from the Public Health Unit, which monitors deaths.   Freshly laid graves at the biggest graveyard in Suceava, in northeast Romania, which has the third-highest Covid-19 mortality rate in the country.A corner of the main cemetery in Suceava, the county seat that\\'s about 10 minutes from Bosanci, is full of freshly dug graves. In the cemetery\\'s chapel, a service is underway.  On the hill behind the chapel, mourners gather for a funeral. Nearby, another grave is being prepared.   The wooden crosses over each new grave don\\'t indicate the cause of death, so it\\'s unclear how many died from the virus. A man working on one of the graves, however, said the number of people being buried of late was far higher than usual.  \"Eternal regrets,\" reads a ribbon draped across one of the graves.  Back in the morgue of the Bucharest University Hospital, a medic hammered a nail into a wooden coffin. A colleague sprayed the coffin with disinfectant.   For those who die of Covid, there will be no open-casket funerals.  \"The vaccine means the difference between life and death,\" said Ionita, the nurse. \"People should understand that. Maybe in their last hour they should understand that.\"For those shrouded in the black body bags before him, it is already too late. ',\n",

You\\'re fighting every known convention.\"   SteroidsBut bodybuilding has a dark side, a long association with steroid use to help build muscle. \"Before she went to the world championships, Rene had to do a drug test and passed the drug test, but a lot of these girls didn\\'t pass,\" Wanda Tierney, chairperson of IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) Women\\'s Committee, tells CNN Sport.Campbell says it would be naïve to think that the problem does not exist, but argues that steroids abuse happens in other sports and in society, too.\"The onus is on the athletes to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their federation,\" Campbell says. \"My federation (The IFBB), is a signatory to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code, and the IFBB anti-doping rules are in full compliance with the 2015 WADA code.\"And as she reflected on her body\\'s evolution, Campbell was keen to stress how bodybuilding had been accompanied by a shift in her mental health.\"It was a very big shift for me mentally, because my bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself.\"',\n",

But low- and middle-income households saw a smaller share of the gains. While a majority (71%) of the wealth accumulation went to high-income earners, middle-income households saw only 26%, and low-income households saw just 4%.Home prices skyrocketed last year. Two regions saw the biggest increasesIn addition, home prices have appreciated so rapidly in some metro areas that new low- and middle-income buyers are priced out of the market entirely.Phoenix saw the biggest price increase over the decade, that concluded at the end of 2021, with a 275% increase. It was followed by Atlanta; Las Vegas; Cape Coral, Florida; and the towns of Riverside and San Bernardino in California, all of which had increases of more than 200%.Read More\"These escalating home values were no doubt beneficial to homeowners and home sellers,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. \"However, as these markets flourish, middle-income wage earners face increasingly difficult affordability issues and are regrettably being priced out of the home-buying process.\" Benefits of homeownershipHomeownership is often the leading source of wealth among families, and its benefits can be powerful.\"Owning a home continues to be a proven method for building long-term wealth,\" said Yun. \"Home values generally grow over time, so homeowners begin the wealth-building process as soon as they make a down payment and move to pay down their mortgage.\" The Black homeownership rate is now lower than it was a decade agoFor example, if you bought a typical single-family home 10 years ago for the median price of $162,600, you\\'re likely to have accumulated $229,400 in housing wealth, according to NAR. Though the middle-class homeownership rate fell overall, the number of middle-income homeowners increased in over half of the 917 metro areas in NAR\\'s analysis. In order to determine which areas had a rising middle class, NAR looked for housing markets that had the greatest growth in middle income, owner-occupied homes between 2010 and 2020. Researchers defined a middle-class household as one earning an income of more than 80% to 200% of the area median income.The top 10 cities with increasing middle-income households during that decade were Phoenix; Austin; Nashville; Dallas; Houston; Atlanta; Orlando; Portland, Oregon; Seattle and Tampa. \"Middle-income households in these growing markets have seen phenomenal gains in price appreciation,\" said Yun. \"Given the rapid migration and robust job growth in these areas, I expect these markets to continue to see impressive price gains.\"Challenges for middle- and low-income buyersBut there were also several large cities that saw a drop in middle-class households over the past decade. These include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Detroit, and Philadelphia. In these and other cities where home prices are rapidly rising, middle- and low-income buyers have struggled to get into the market.Low-income homeowners comprised a smaller fraction of all homeowners in 2020, at just 27%, the NAR research found, down from 38% in 2010. How much house can I afford? While middle-income homeowners increased in number over the decade, they represented a smaller share of homeowners in 2020, at 43%, down from 45.5% in 2010. The share of high-income homeowners grew, rising to 30%, up from 16.4% in 2010. That is 11.1 million more high-income households in 2020 compared to 2010.\"Homeownership is rewarding in so many ways and can serve as a vital component in achieving financial stability,\" said Leslie Rouda Smith, a real estate agent from Plano, Texas, and a broker associate at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate in Dallas, who is the NAR President. \"Now, we must focus on increasing access to safe, affordable housing and ensuring that more people can begin to amass and pass on the gains from homeownership.\"',\n",
       " 'Fears of unlikely federal gun-control measures lead to raft of state laws - CNNPolitics Brandon Steele, a second-term Republican in West Virginia\\'s House, worked Amid fears on social media and by gun-rights groups that the Second Amendment is under threat, GOP lawmakers have rushed to pass state laws seeking to blunt any federal gun restrictions the Biden administration might adopt. politics, Fears of unlikely federal gun-control measures lead to raft of state laws - CNNPolitics Fears of unlikely federal gun-control measures lead to raft of state laws  (CNN)Brandon Steele, a second-term Republican in West Virginia\\'s House, worked hard this year to get his colleagues to pass his \"Second Amendment Preservation Act.\" It seeks to bar state or local police from enforcing new federal gun restrictions the Biden administration might adopt. Mind you, Steele himself concedes he doesn\\'t see significant new federal restrictions getting passed anytime soon. \"The Biden administration has not gotten anywhere in terms of pushing their firearms regulatory agenda; they haven\\'t even got their ATF guy in there,\" he told CNN. \"There are a lot of forces in play to keep that from happening.\"With a 50-50 US Senate, a paper-thin margin in the House, and Biden focused on other priorities, advocates on both sides acknowledge that sweeping measures to address gun violence appear unlikely.But that hasn\\'t stopped gun-rights groups and politicians across the country from ginning up fears that Biden wants to, as Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz put it, \"erase the Second Amendment,\" and come to people\\'s homes and take away their guns. Read MoreGOP lawmakers in at least 17 states have introduced bills this year taking aim at possible federal gun restrictions, a CNN review has found. Nine of those states signed new laws that take a page from the immigration sanctuary movement (which limited state and local police from helping with federal immigration enforcement), by barring local and state police agencies from helping enforce any new federal gun laws.  And two states, Missouri and Arizona, enacted measures that conflict with existing federal gun laws in ways that prosecutors tell CNN already are making it harder, or risk making it harder, to investigate gun crimes.  The inflammatory rhetoric surrounding these new laws, critics says, is similar and even connected to claims of 2020 election fraud and pushback against Covid-19 vaccine or mask mandates in that they rely on a denial of reality. \"They are part of an ideological system, [and believe] that the other side -- in this case, the Democrats -- are devious and intent on taking political rights away and imposing a socialistic tyranny,\" said Alexandra Filindra, a political science professor at University of Illinois, Chicago, who studies gun politics, disinformation and social media. \"Information that conflicts with this narrative is dismissed,\" she said. \"Saying Biden is a Democrat and coming for your guns is a great way to motivate anger and get people to vote in the midterm, especially.\" Missouri \"suspends participation\"While most of the new gun laws are aimed at some perceived future threat to gun ownership, the ones in Missouri and Arizona, at a minimum, have the potential to undermine present-day law enforcement investigations. Soon after Missouri adopted its \"Second Amendment Preservation Act\" in June, at least a dozen federally deputized state and local law enforcement officers withdrew from joint task forces where they\\'d worked with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate violent gun crimes and illegal gun trafficking, according to Frederic Winston, the head of ATF\\'s Kansas City field office.Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. John Hotz confirmed it \"has suspended participation\" in ATF\\'s joint task force. As a result, Winston said, the patrol stopped submitting firearms-trace requests to ATF, and stopped assisting in referrals to the FBI\\'s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, for investigations of people who get a firearm from a licensed dealer despite being prohibited from doing so. Missouri\\'s act seeks to nullify any federal gun laws that tax guns, ammunition or accessories; that register or track firearms or firearms ownership; or that would confiscate or forbid the ownership, use, or transfer of guns by \"law-abiding citizens.\" It says no state or local officers or officials \"can have authority to enforce or attempt to enforce\" such laws.State lawmakers also adopted an approach used in Texas\\' controversial abortion legislation by letting residents sue, for up to $50,000, local or state police who enforce federal gun laws that fall afoul of the act. US Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), right, speaks during a Second Amendment Rally Sept. 16, 2021, at a gun store in Midland, Texas.Frederic Winston, the head of the ATF\\'s Kansas City field office, said in a court declaration that the act \"deprives law enforcement of information needed to successfully investigate crimes, including violent crimes.\" The city of St. Louis filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law shortly after it was passed. The Department of Justice supported that effort, arguing that under the US \"Constitution\\'s Supremacy Clause, the State of Missouri has no power to nullify federal laws.\" Like Missouri\\'s law, Arizona\\'s \"Second Amendment Sanctuary\" act, signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey in May, applies to current federal firearms laws. It orders state and local police agencies not to enforce or cooperate with any federal measures that are \"inconsistent with any law of this state regarding the regulation of firearms.\" That bar on enforcement is modeled on California\\'s 2017 immigration sanctuary law, state Rep. Leo Biasiucci, its author, told The Washington Monthly. Biasiucci didn\\'t respond to repeated interview requests from CNN.States can\\'t simply claim to nullify federal firearms laws that go farther than state laws, said Jonathan Lowy, chief legal counsel of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. If they think a law is unconstitutional, they can challenge it in court, he said. \"That\\'s the way you do it:  You challenge laws. You don\\'t say, \\'I\\'m not going to follow federal law.\\'\"Unlike in Missouri, federal and state law enforcement officials in Arizona say they haven\\'t seen changes in joint task forces or other collaborations to investigate illegal gun trafficking or violent gun crimes. Arizona\\'s gun law did swiftly draw a backlash from the Tucson City Council, which in June adopted a resolution to continue enforcing federal gun laws.  Tucson, where several churches were early leaders in the 1980s immigration sanctuary movement, and where the 2011 shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and 18 other people in a grocery-store parking lot remains etched into memory, has often clashed with the state\\'s GOP-dominated leadership. \"We fully intend to enforce federal gun laws in Arizona,\" said Tucson City Council Member Steve Kozachik. \"I believe their nullification amendment is highly unconstitutional, and it\\'s not anywhere close to being in the best interests of our constituents to say we\\'re going to opt out of federal gun laws.\"Immigration sanctuary modelLegal experts across the spectrum say that while provisions in Missouri and Arizona\\'s laws appear to go too far, other recent acts, such as West Virginia\\'s \"Second Amendment Preservation and Anti-Federal Commandeering Act,\" are likely to survive legal challenges. Those measures rely on what\\'s known as the \"anti-commandeering\" doctrine, which holds that the federal government can\\'t make state or local authorities enforce federal regulations on its behalf. That doctrine has repeatedly been upheld in recent cases involving immigration-sanctuary laws adopted by dozens of cities, from Seattle and San Francisco to Jackson, Mississippi.  \"It\\'s perfectly constitutional for state officials to opt not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement or federal gun enforcement,\" said Eric Ruben, an assistant professor of law at Southern Methodist University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy think tank. Some state GOP lawmakers who, under President Donald Trump, passed laws to preempt cities from declaring themselves immigration sanctuaries, initially shied at embracing a sanctuary approach for guns. \"I actually had some members balk at the concept of using the word sanctuary,\" said state Rep. Scotty Campbell, of Mountain City, Tennessee, about his gun-protection bill. \"I argued it was known and understood as a Second Amendment Sanctuary. They didn\\'t want to use the word sanctuary.\"  The new laws seeking to stave off gun restrictions echo gun-advocacy efforts under President Barack Obama that led to seven states adopting similar measures between 2010 and 2016.  Even modest efforts to address gun safety often are painted by opponents as apocalyptic threats. Groups such as Gun Owners of America characterized Biden\\'s recent call to restrict stabilizing gun braces, for example, as \"disarming the American people.\"Last fall, the Trump campaign ran ads in key battleground states that clipped comments Biden made during a CNN interview, taking them out of context to falsely make it sound as though he planned to take away voters\\' guns. Cruz shared a similar false video on social media on the eve of Biden\\'s first joint address to Congress, and claimed that Biden wants to \"erase the Second Amendment.\" In September, Fox News explicitly tied guns and Covid-19 together with a piece titled: \"Second Amendment groups on Biden mandate: If he can force a needle in your arm, can he take your gun?\"  Demonstrators rally outside the US Supreme Court in Washington,  November 3, 2021. The Supreme Court was set to hear arguments in a gun-rights case that centers on  whether limits the state of New York has placed on carrying a gun in public violate the Second Amendment. In interviews with CNN, lawmakers in several states cited such fears as justification for their gun-rights bills.\"We didn\\'t know how far they\\'d go to restrict private gun ownership,\" said Arkansas state Rep. Brandt Smith, for example. \"Confiscation of guns? Restrictions of the purchase of firearms? We wanted to be proactive and prevent that.\" Americans own more guns than ever, and more guns per capita than any other country in the world. Researchers for the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey estimated that Americans, with 4.3% of the world\\'s population, owned 393 million guns, or 46% of all guns owned by private citizens worldwide, in 2018, the most recent year the survey was conducted. And Americans have bought an estimated 36.9 million more firearms in the past two years, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm based in South Carolina. Since the US has no national gun registry, gun ownership and sales are estimated by surveys, firearms industry publications, and background checks. These GOP-led efforts to guard against future gun restrictions come at a time when some gun-control measures enjoy broad support. More than 80 percent of people in the US (including 70 percent of Republicans) said they support expanded background checks for guns, in an April 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center. The survey said about half of Americans see gun violence as a major problem in the US -- understandable, given that, according to the Gun Violence Archive, 37,820 people have been shot to death in the US this year through Nov. 4, including 20,328 suicides. But it\\'s the fear of losing guns that animates the call to bar such measures. State Sen. Joey Hensley, who cosponsored a Second Amendment sanctuary bill in Tennessee, said his constituents \"were very concerned about the federal government making more restrictions\" on guns.  \"I\\'m personally not afraid so much of the federal government. I think we have plenty of protections under the Second Amendment and I think the Supreme Court would protect our rights,\" said Hensley. \"But we wanted to get some legislation on the books, so people knew where we stood.\" Filindra, the political scientist, said that the gun-rights narrative has been shifting, from a focus on using guns for self or home protection, to \"the idea that citizens have a right to arms as a check on government, and that without that, the franchise is insecure ... if the voting box is insufficient to guarantee our rights, we have the ammo box.\" In this narrative, she said, \"threats to gun rights are existential threats to democracy.\" Whether or not Congress actually can pass a substantial gun-control measure is beside the point, said Sarah Byner, research director for Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics and its effect on public policies and elections. \"That\\'s something about the political climate we\\'re in. Even if it\\'s out of the realm of anything being discussed in the Congress, people aren\\'t following Congress; people aren\\'t police experts. They respond to the messages and that\\'s what these groups are putting out into the world, facts be damned,\" she said.    ',\n",

How Twitter became so toxic for India\\'s women politicians - CNN Women politicians in India face high levels of harassment, including sexist abuse from organized \"troll armies,\" discouraging their political participation, new Amnesty International study finds. india, Troll armies, \\'deepfake\\' porn videos and violent threats. How Twitter became so toxic for India\\'s women politicians - CNN Troll armies, \\'deepfake\\' porn videos and violent threats. How Twitter became so toxic for India\\'s women politicians CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, an ongoing series. New Delhi, India — Sitting on a wicker chair in her East Delhi office, Kavita Krishnan readjusts her glasses and scrolls through Twitter, surveying the latest slew of abusive messages. In a nearby room, her cat purrs.The politician and activist, a powerful voice for women\\'s rights in India, says she receives near \"nonstop\" harassment -- anywhere from 50 to 100 abusive messages a day on Twitter -- for being an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Waving her free hand as she clutches her phone with the other, Krishnan reads a collection of offensive tweets she\\'s compiled, categorized by the type of trolling.\"These trolls ... they are going after me regularly, routinely, for my skin color, for my looks, telling me I\\'m not worth raping, what kind of torture and rape I should be subjected to, telling me what kind of men I should be sleeping with ... and on and on and on, more and more,\" Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women\\'s Association and a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, tells CNN.\"There is an organized army of far-right trolls on Indian social media, which belong to the ruling party, they are basically trained to target you for anything,\" she adds.Read MoreCNN has made multiple attempts to reach the BJP\\'s social media spokesperson for comment on these claims.Kavita KrishnanTrolling has become embedded in the fabric of political life globally, but perhaps nowhere more than in India, home to the world\\'s biggest democracy. Modi, second only to President Donald Trump as the most followed world leader on Twitter, has been slammed by members of the public and opposition politicians for following trolls from his personal account. And his party has frequently been accused of operating a \"troll army,\" which critics say targets Modi\\'s opponents -- especially prominent female figures -- with sexual harassment and abuse. The head of the BJP\\'s IT cell, Amit Malviya, has said that the criticism of Modi is contorted, that he follows \"normal people\" and has never blocked or unfriended anyone.\"Mr. Modi is possibly the only leader in the world, who actually follows handles which give rape threats, death threats, actually put out incitement videos, peddle fake news,\" Swati Chaturvedi, the author of, \"I Am a Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP\\'s Digital Army.\"\"The BJP has this ecosystem where everything is geared towards attacking people, particularly sexually ... they share defamatory slurs, sexual slurs on women, journalists, activists, women politicians, who they essentially don\\'t agree with.\"Against this backdrop, prominent women politicians routinely find themselves subject to manipulated online posts, a worrying trend in a country where fake news has led to violence.But while there is anecdotal evidence that trolling is an endemic problem for women in India, there has been limited research into its effect on their political lives.In an effort to close that gap, Amnesty International tracked the Twitter mentions of 95 female politicians (including Krishnan) in the run up to, during and after the country\\'s general election last year.According to their findings, first seen by CNN, about one in seven tweets sent to the women were abusive or problematic. The study suggests that women politicians in India face high levels of harassment, including hateful, sexist abuse which could result in discouraging their political participation. That poses a particularly pressing problem for India, where women are already significantly under-represented in politics. While last year\\'s vote saw a record-setting 78 women elected to the Lok Sabha, India\\'s lower house, that\\'s still only 14% of the house\\'s representatives. A bill pushing for a third of parliamentary seats to be reserved for women -- backed by the BJP and main opposition Congress Party (INC) in the last election cycle -- is still in limbo, more than a decade after it was introduced.At a time when female lawmakers are quitting over cyber bullying elsewhere -- including in the US and UK -- women\\'s rights advocates say the scale of trolling in India could be an additional barrier to improving gender parity in politics there.According to Amnesty, women politicians in India receive nearly twice the amount of trolling experienced by their female counterparts in the United States and United Kingdom.The silencing effectWith the release of the \"Troll Patrol India\" report, conducted using a combination of crowdsourcing and machine learning, Amnesty has attempted to shed light on how harassment and abuse might deter female politicians from freely posting their views on the platform, or even contesting elections altogether.More than 1,900 volunteers from 82 countries analyzed tweets sent to 95 women politicians during the general elections, from March to May of 2019.The volunteers were trained to spot abusive content -- tweets that promote violence against or threaten people based on their identification with a group, like race, gender or religion, which violates Twitter\\'s own rules -- and problematic tweets, which Amnesty defines as \"hurtful or hostile content,\" but does not necessarily meet the threshold of abuse.     Amnesty estimated that, of the 7.1 million tweets mentioning the women, nearly 1 million were abusive or problematic.That\\'s 113 problematic or abusive tweets per woman per day, on average.\"Online abuse on Twitter demeans women, it invalidates their voice, it belittles them, it intimidates them, and it can silence them,\" Nazia Erum, head of media and advocacy for Amnesty International India, told CNN.  \"The study has found that the more prominent you are, the more abused you will get, which effectively means that a lot of women move back from the amount of engagement that they do on Twitter, they self-censor, or they quit.\"Given the sheer scale and nature of online abuse revealed in the report, Amnesty has called on Twitter \"to do more to meet its business and human rights obligations and responsibilities,\" Erum said.A Twitter spokesperson told CNN that, while it had not seen a copy of the report or data ahead of its publication, abuse and harassment had \"no place\" on the platform. The spokesperson added that Twitter had taken \"strong steps\" to address these issues, including during the Indian general election in 2019.\\'Trolling is not a crime\\'Alka Lamba remembers the horror she felt when she logged onto Facebook to see a fake news article circulating with her photographs. The story claimed that she was the ringleader of a prostitution ring, which was broken up in a police raid on her home.\"They say that the truth cannot be hidden and that the truth will always be revealed, but by the time the truth does come out, the lies have gone on for so long and the damage is done,\" Lamba, an INC party politician and until recently a member of the New Delhi legislative assembly, told CNN.Alka LambaFaced with an overwhelming swarm of accounts spreading the disinformation about her, Lamba says she considered getting off social media entirely. But, in the end, Lamba decided she didn\\'t want the trolls to feel they had succeeded in silencing her. Instead of leaving the platforms, she filed a complaint to India\\'s Cyber Crime Investigation Unit.  Six months after first reporting the disinformation, and working to track down the trolls, Lamba asked the unit what progress they had made.\"I was shown the profile pictures of all the men against whom I had filed the complaint. They showed me that all of them were standing next to the Prime Minister in their profile pictures and they are all being followed by the PM,\" she recalled. \"They said that, \\'to tell you the truth, nothing is going to happen, and this is just a waste of time.\\'\" Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police, Cyber Crime Unit, told CNN he was not aware of the complaint filed by Lamba, but that if \"criminal offense is seen, then appropriate legal action is taken.\" A news report from the time did indicate that charges were filed in the matter; it\\'s unclear how the case was disposed.\"Trolling is not defined as a crime. It all depends on the nature of the content. According to that, we ask the host to take the content down,\" Roy said.Seeking cyber justiceThere aren\\'t many legal avenues for women to take when confronted with online abuse. India doesn\\'t have any uniform law to specifically address alleged digital crimes targeting women. Response from authorities to online threats of gender-based violence is often insufficient or reactive, and reporting mechanisms are in need of re-evaluation, Dr. Debarati Halder, managing director of the Center For Cyber Victim Counseling and co-author of Cyber Crimes Against Women in India, says. \"We do not have any focused law to prohibit and penalize online bullying, trolling, including gender bullying and ... doxing [publishing a target\\'s personal details online],\" Halder told CNN.Those who do report cyber harassment to police, or take cases to court, often get \"victim blamed,\" she says, adding that, as a result, online abuse is often under-reported by women. Halder, whose research has looked at the trolling and abuse of women politicians, journalists, celebrities and activists, says that India\\'s patriarchal social structure has taken on a new dimension online, where men vandalize women\\'s internet profiles, use filthy language to describe their sex appeal, publish intimate images without their consent or share doctored imagery -- known as \"deepfakes\" -- depicting them in pornography.India\\'s youngest parliamentarian, Chandrani Murmu, was subjected to such a \"deepfake,\" with her face superimposed onto an obscene video, before she was elected last year.\\'I did not sign up to politics to be abused\\'Though Amnesty\\'s research has not linked abuse on Twitter as originating from specific political parties, it did show that women politicians from the BJP were less likely to be trolled than their peers. But Shazia Ilmi, Delhi BJP vice president and spokeswoman, challenged the suggestion that her party is to blame for the toxic atmosphere female politicians face online, saying it was \"completely false.\"Ilmi, who is Muslim, says she too has been on the receiving end of harassment on social media.Shazia IlmiIlmi has been the subject of a torrent of sexual harassment on Twitter, including threats of gang rape, and has blocked almost 200 accounts as a way to cope. On Facebook, she recalled a case in which a troll shared images of \"skimpily clad\" women with her face morphed onto them, claiming to her friends and family that she ran a brothel. A Facebook spokesperson told CNN that the company had developed \"clear policies against behaviors that disproportionately affect women,\" and that it continues to work closely with women\\'s safety experts in India \"to make sure we\\'re doing everything we can to keep women safe on our services -- whether they are private individuals or in the public eye.\"\"Anybody can pick up any porn movie, put your face on one of the characters and send it to everyone you know. And you know who all read it, they are my mamus and my khalas -- my uncles and aunts -- they are there, they see it. You know how embarrassing it is?\" Ilmi said.\"I signed up to be in politics, but I did not sign up to be abused and have sexually explicit comments made at me ad nauseum.\"     Ilmi said she also reported her harassment to India\\'s Cyber Crime Investigation Unit, which wrote back to her after two years to say they had been in touch with Twitter, but could do nothing else. The deputy commissioner of police for the Cyber Crime Unit said he was unaware of Ilmi\\'s case.Misogyny on social mediaFemale politicians, women\\'s rights activists and experts say the volume of abuse online reflects the cultural realities in India, where patriarchy is deeply rooted and gender inequality rife. Social media platforms, like Twitter, have become a double-edged sword: offering women a platform to speak their minds freely, and yet another sphere to be harassed.One in every five tweets sent to the group of female politicians and flagged as abusive or problematic was identified as sexist or misogynistic, according to the Amnesty study.\"You have to recognize that this kind of political violence exists both offline, as well as online, and it works to try and intimidate women, not just women in politics but women who are stepping out of line socially anyway,\" Krishnan said emphatically, gesturing to the street outside.The headquarters for her political party is in a busy part of India\\'s capital city, a crush of crowded six-story buildings, where many young people and professionals stay in cheap guest accommodations so that they can work or study. It\\'s not a place many women might feel particularly safe after dark.Krishnan, who was heavily involved in protests over the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old Delhi student in 2012, says the atmosphere for women -- both online and off -- has worsened in recent years as mob violence has become normalized in Indian politics.\"The violence is there to intimidate and dissuade us and it is far worse than ever before in our country today, because we have a fascist, far-right politics that is trying to push back the gains of several centuries of women\\'s struggles,\" Krishnan said.\"I believe that we all either have to be in it or all of us lose.\"\\n\\n Click here for more stories from the As Equals series.',\n",

Macy, Stephen Fry, Kurtwood Smith, Bill Irwin, and Anne Archer.Still, Seyfried steals the show, from the youthful version of Holmes to the one who worked at everything related to her carefully crafted image -- from choosing her black turtleneck look to the tenor of her voice, rehearsing the delivery in the mirror.There\\'s also something stiff and artificial about her personal interactions, a point she makes overtly to her lover and partner Sunny Balwani (\"Lost\\'s\" Naveen Andrews), telling him, \"I don\\'t feel things the way other people feel things,\" while insisting she cares about him nonetheless.Framed by Holmes giving a deposition, the series chronicles how she misrepresented revenues and testing failures, while wooing politicians, dignitaries and investors.There are also tantalizing subplots in Theranos\\' fate, from the young whistleblowers -- Tyler Shultz (Dylan Minnette), Shultz\\'s grandson, and Erika Cheung (Camryn Mi-young Kim) -- who came forward to expose Theranos\\'s misdeeds to the Wall Street Journal reporter (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) who helped break the story, even as the paper\\'s owner, Rupert Murdoch, was among those investing in the company.\"The Dropout\" is just the latest look at the cutthroat world of such start-ups, coming close on the heels of \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,\" which shares some of the same tragic excesses.Even with a high bar for such fare, thanks largely to Seyfried, \"The Dropout\" gets under your skin, passing the \"Should I watch?\" test with flying colors.\"The Dropout\" premieres March 3 on Hulu.',\n",

Experts say the government is still getting it wrong - CNN Covid-19 has killed 100,000 people in the UK. Experts say the government is still getting it wrong London (CNN)In March last year, the UK government said it was hopeful the country could cap its coronavirus deaths at 20,000. It was a bleak target to set, but one the nation came to begrudgingly accept.Ten months on, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a somber public briefing Tuesday, in which he announced the country could now count more than 100,000 people as its Covid-19 dead, in what he called a \"grim statistic.\" Of the worst-affected nations, the UK has earned the dishonor of having the highest number of confirmed deaths in the world, proportionate to population.A surge in case numbers\\xa0that began\\xa0in December has\\xa0pushed\\xa0hospitals\\xa0to the brink. ICU workers say they have been forced to \"dilute\" their care and describe mental health struggles under unprecedented pressure.\\xa0Schools are shut and have moved online, disrupting the lives of students and working parents alike. All but essential shops are closed. In England, socializing, even outdoors, is banned, except in pairs for exercise.\\xa0London\\'s ICU nurses detail depression and disaster Read MoreThere are few differences from the spring, when Britons suffered a devastating first wave and were put under a draconian lockdown. They are now asking themselves how they got here. Yet again.When asked that very thing, Johnson has repeatedly pointed to a new and more contagious variant of the virus, now infamously known around the world as the \"UK variant.\"\\xa0Health Secretary Matt Hancock too has claimed the country\\'s response was working until the new variant hit.But it\\'s not that simple. Like in the first wave, the government has been slow to respond to rising case and death numbers with restrictions. It has failed to get an adequate contact-tracing and isolation system running. And\\xa0it has, again, been slow on border controls, only closing \"travel corridors\" with more than 60 countries or territories in mid-January amid record-breaking daily death tolls.Experts say\\xa0the government hasn\\'t learned from its past mistakes and still lacks a coherent strategy.\\xa0Prof. Anne Johnson, president of the UK\\'s Academy of Medical Sciences, said there was a clear correlation with the relaxation of restrictions\\xa0before Christmas\\xa0and\\xa0the recent spike in infections.\"The new variant is important and more transmissible, but that\\'s not the only cause of the third wave. Let\\'s be clear,\" she told CNN.\\xa0Boris Johnson had for weeks been telling the nation they could celebrate Christmas with friends and families, allowing a mixing of households if they just followed the rules during a November lockdown. He called the whole thing off at the 11th hour, at least in\\xa0England\\'s worst-hit counties.\\xa0But it was too late. The damage had been done well before the holidays began, and medical staff knew they would be in for a tough January.\"Inevitably, if you come out of lockdown on the 2nd\\xa0of December, as we did, with people gagging to get to the shops and get out and about, and we\\'ve got three weeks before Christmas, that\\'s going to be clearly a moment for seeing more transmission,\" Prof. Anne Johnson said.A quiet street in London during lockdown on January 15.In the aftermath, the Prime Minister argued the government could not have foreseen the new, more transmissible variant. But the idea that viruses mutate, sometimes in the shape of more aggressive forms, is widely understood.\\xa0It was even flagged as a potential threat in a July report by the Academy of Medical Sciences, for which Prof. Anne Johnson was a lead author. The government had commissioned the report for the precise purpose of preparing for the difficult winter it knew was coming.In July last year, the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had not read the report when asked in parliament. In January, six months later, he did not answer a question by the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr in an interview on whether he had finally gotten around to reading it. His office did not answer a question from CNN on whether he had now read it. It\\'s an example of what the Prime Minister\\'s critics say is his aversion to detail.\\xa0The Johnson government has long emphasized learning to live with Covid-19, simply accepting a certain level of circulation in the community. Had he taken the winter report\\'s warning seriously, however, he may have understood the additional threat of a new variant.The report, along with several others from medical experts, also raised concerns about the country\\'s test, trace and isolate system. Testing has improved dramatically, but tracing and isolating hasn\\'t. Anecdotal evidence is growing that an app designed to aid the process is largely inactive.\\xa0The Department of Health told CNN that the app had been downloaded more than 21 million times and was still a key tool in helping break chains of transmission. A student takes a swab for a Covid-19 test at the University of Hull in northern England on November 30, 2020.But compliance is a major issue. In an ongoing survey of people\\'s behavior and feelings around Covid-19 in the UK by the University College London, 38% of respondents said they were not isolating after developing symptoms for the full recommended 10-day period. Some 13% said they were not isolating at all. And 75% of adults over the age of 60 who reported experiencing symptoms at least once said they had never bothered requesting a test.The study\\'s lead author, Dr Daisy Fancour, said\\xa0in a statement\\xa0the number of respondents not isolating was \"deeply concerning.\"\\xa0The study also finds a correlation between isolation compliance and income level. This suggests that many people breaking rules on isolation are doing so because of financial pressures.\\xa0\"The increased adherence to self-isolation rules among those with a higher household income suggests that many of those not isolating are breaking guidelines due to financial concerns, and more support needs to be put in place to allow people to self-isolate without fear of losing out financially,\"\\xa0Fancour said.\\xa0\\'Too little, too late\\'After the hardship of the first wave, it\\'s difficult to comprehend why the government hasn\\'t adopted the models seen in countries\\xa0that have been more successful in their responses, particularly in terms of border controls.\\xa0UK Home Secretary Priti Patel admitted to a group of Conservative Party supporters that the government should have closed borders in March, according to a video published by the pro-Conservative website Guido Fawkes. She claimed that she had supported the idea at the time.Passengers queue at a check-in desk at Heathrow Airport in London on December 21.The UK may have finally hardened its border, but it\\'s easy to see how more cases could slip through the net. Most of the country now requires people crossing its borders to self-isolate for 10 days, but it has no robust mechanism to ensure people are complying.\\xa0In Canada, arrivals isolate at home, but police check in with them. Rule-breakers face up to six months in jail. Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore use electronic wristbands to ensure people stay home during quarantine periods. They are controversial from a privacy perspective, but they broadly work.And in Australia, arrivals are forced to stay for two weeks in strict government-monitored \"quarantine hotels.\" Arrivals have to pay for their own quarantine, charged at a rate of around $3,000 ($2,3000) for one adult in most states. It\\'s a measure Johnson\\'s government is only now considering. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, chastized Johnson in a scathing speech earlier this month, saying his indecision was costing lives. England considers putting Covid patients in hotels, as study reveals deep trauma among ICU workers\"Every time there\\'s a big decision to make, Boris Johnson gets there too late,\" he said. \"The government says it\\'s trying to balance the health crisis with the economic crisis. Yet we ended 2020 with one of the worst death tolls in Europe and the deepest recession of any major economy. That\\'s not bad luck. That wasn\\'t inevitable. It\\'s the consequence of the PM\\'s repeated delay and incompetence.\"Enforcing the kind of border controls seen in Australia wouldn\\'t be hard -- when you take out Northern Ireland, the UK is essentially an island around the size of the state of Kansas. The export of the UK variant to 60 countries demonstrates how porous the UK\\'s border has been.Australia, a country of 25 million people, has reported just over 900 deaths. It has been able to keep the virus at bay with its quarantine hotels in conjunction with swift local lockdowns, granular data and transparency that has won the public\\'s trust, according to a report by consulting firm McKinsey.The country is now working on its economy\\'s recovery as the UK struggles just to keep its own open.\\xa0When asked by a reporter whether he could have done more to prevent deaths, Johnson said he took full responsibility for his government\\'s response but made no admissions of any missteps.\"We did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life in this country as a result of the pandemic, and I\\'m deeply sorry for every life lost.\"The threat of vaccine complacencyJohnson also sought on Tuesday to focus on the UK\\'s success with its vaccine program. The UK was the first country to begin vaccinating people with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 shot, and to date it has given at least 6.8 million people the first of two doses.\\xa0The prospect of success here could offer Johnson the political get-out-of-jail card he sorely needs.A member of the public is inoculated at a temporary vaccination center in Sheffield, northern England, on January 23.But for the vaccine rollout to be a success, Johnson\\'s government will need to smooth out its distribution, which some medical service providers say has been haphazard to date, though it is early days.\"There are clearly issues around supply,\" said Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents providers of the government-funded National Health Service. But he is not aware of whether the problem is one of supply or of distribution.The Department of Health and Social Care declined to tell CNN how many vaccine doses the country had in stock, saying it was now part of the country\\'s critical infrastructure, citing \"security reasons\" for withholding details on supplies. But it said that the country\\'s \"vaccine supply and scheduled deliveries will fully support\" the country\\'s program, including the immunization of four key groups by February 15. \"The UK has already vaccinated more people than any other country in Europe, and we are mobilizing the government, NHS and our armed forces as part of a massive national effort to lead us out of this crisis,\" it said. Covid-19 vaccines are given with organ music at UK\\'s historic Salisbury Cathedral Supply concerns are compounded by the pressure to administer a large number of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fast. Rigid temperature requirements mean doses that are refrigerated need to be used in five days. With a box typically containing 1,000 doses, surgeries and vaccine centers have to administer 200 shots a day to ensure no doses in a box go to waste.\\xa0\\xa0Mortimer said the vaccine program was \"truly impressive\" in scale and had given worn-out NHS workers a huge boost in morale, but he emphasized the urgent need to improve distribution.\\xa0Like many health experts, he warns against the UK becoming too reliant on the vaccine as a silver bullet.\\xa0Improving other measures -- especially the test, trace and isolate system -- is crucial to bringing infection numbers down until there is a high level of immunity in the country, which may not be until the end of the year, Mortimer explained.\\xa0\"We need to know that as the vaccine is rolled out, and as it takes time for the vaccine to gain efficacy, that those elements of tracing and isolating are robust, and are robust for the longer term. It\\'s probably too early to say we have full confidence in that, but it\\'s really important the government gets that right,\" he said.\\xa0\"The sad reality of this last 10 months is that NHS organizations have seen this virus do real harm to their communities. We can see this in a really depressing death toll, but we can also see it in the longer-term impact the virus having on people\\'s health.\"',\n",

We have to thank the many people who have made this journey possible,\" Garcia Aguilera said in his first public comment since leaving Cuba.\"I have been without communication for several days and need to update on the situation of other members of the Archipelago,\" he added, referring to his opposition group.The organizer of protests that were thwarted by Cuban police had not been seen since a mob of hardline pro-government supporters surrounded his house on Sunday, a spokesman for Archipelago group said on Tuesday.Read MoreMagdiel Jorge Castro told CNN that the last time activists spoke with García Aguilera was on Sunday at 6 p.m. local time. A member of the group went to his house on Tuesday to try to locate him, but after knocking for more than an hour at his door, no one opened or answered, he added.Garcia Aguilera faced possible arrest and trial in Cuba for his role in organizing the protests -- intended to call for greater political freedoms -- which had been planned for Monday but never took place.Cuban police arrested at least 11 people while government agents and supporters had \"besieged\" 50 others inside their homes to forestall the demonstration, the Havana-based independent human rights organization Cubalex told CNN. Cuban activists also said they were blockaded inside their homes on Sunday and Monday. Protests are permitted under the Cuban constitution -- but in practice, police routinely arrest anyone suspected anti-government activity and protestors face lengthy prison sentences. The government had vowed not to allow the demonstrations, claiming they were a pretext to stir up trouble on the communist-run island, and that they had been secretly organized by Cuban exiles and the US government. There was a heavy police across Cuba on Monday morning as authorities prepared to face potential protesters. Ultimately, streets remained quiet, however -- evidence of the chilling effects of the government\\'s warnings.',\n",

But on January 6, 2021, after witnessing the horrors of a deadly, armed insurrection at the US Capitol building, he deemed that -- in that moment -- such a tradition was no longer appropriate, or indeed practical. \"When I heard the attackers trying to get in,\" Allred explained, \"I took off my suit jacket coat, stood up and was prepared to fight or do whatever I had to do if somebody got on the floor.\" Allred knows how to look after himself; he spent five years as a linebacker with the Tennessee Titans in the NFL and thought he\\'d seen it all -- until January. Read More\"It was surreal, it really was. I\\'ve played in some really tough atmospheres; I\\'ve had things thrown at me and people cursing at me, but I\\'ve never seen anything like the rage and mob mentality that we saw that day.\" Allred had heard the glass breaking, witnessed the doors being hurriedly fortified and knew the Capitol building had been breached for the first time in more than 200 years. \"It really is the heart of heart of our democracy,\" the 37-year-old Democratic lawmaker said. \"And to see violence come to that place, to see Americans using the American flag to attack police officers, the Confederate flag being walked through the halls of Congress -- something that never happened during the Civil War, I was very sad that day.\" A pro-Trump mob confronts U.S. Capitol police outside the Senate chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC.Eventually, Allred and his fellow lawmakers were evacuated to safety, but he said his fellow Democrats were glad to have him on their side. \"A number of my colleagues told me afterwards that they felt comforted I was there and that they planned on being behind me.\"  He did, however, wonder how that scenario might otherwise have played out. \"I thought, well, I didn\\'t have any weapons or anything, you know?\" Allred describes the insurrection as \"really led by President Trump,\" and \"a near-death experience for our democracy.\" He was horrified by the violence in the Capitol, but equally disturbed by the animosity later that evening when the lawmakers returned to the Chamber to certify the results of the US presidential election.Tensions were still high, as Republicans were accused of inspiring the mob with lies.\"There was a back and forth between some members on our side and on their side. One of their members dove into the aisle and basically said something along the lines of: \\'Let\\'s fight.\\' Pro-Trump supporters storm the US Capitol  on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.The scene played out but was off camera. It was witnessed by a CNN producer. Lawmakers from either side of the aisle yelled at each other to \"sit down,\" a tense exchange that resulted in at least a dozen other members bench clearing from their sides.According to CNN\\'s Kristin Wilson, who was in the room, the situation diffused fairly quickly but tensions were high. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, confirmed the incident in a statement. \"Nothing physical ever happened, or was going to happen.  Mr. Allred stepped in only to ease tensions at the end of a difficult day,\" he said.\"This is about 3 a.m.\" recalled Allred. \"And I was just so incensed at the idea that, even after all the violence we had seen that day, that this guy had not had enough.  \"And so, I said to him, \\'Are you serious? Have you not had enough violence for one day?\\'\" Not for the first time in his career, Allred found himself playing defense, putting his 238 pound frame on the line for his team.\"I got in his way and of course, he\\'s not going to try and get past me. I thought I left a background in the NFL where you handle a disagreement by putting someone on the ground.\"  Representative Colin Allred, D-TX, speaks in front of the US Supreme Court on April 2, 2019.READ: Baseball star took a knee and then his life unraveled in Trump\\'s AmericaGrowing up in the 1980s in Northern Texas, Allred wasn\\'t unlike many other young boys dreaming of being a professional athlete. \"I didn\\'t really think I was going to become one,\" he noted, \"I was very realistic about it, but I wanted to be a centerfield baseball player for the Texas Rangers.\" He was raised by a single mother and baseball was her favorite sport, but she didn\\'t care much for his athletic career. \"I\\'d come home and say I had a great game,\" he recalled, knowing that he\\'d inevitably be met with the response, \"OK that\\'s fine. How\\'d you do on that test?\" Allred knew he\\'d need to rely on his education. He considered being a doctor and then a lawyer, but his dream of being a professional athlete didn\\'t go away. \"Just kind of turned out that my body type and my talents were better for football,\" he said.   Allred attended Baylor University on a football scholarship and was fully anticipating a transition to law school when it was put to him by a scout that he could still make it to the NFL. Allred was so unsure of his own potential that he said he would selflessly offer to introduce the scouts who were looking at him to his teammates, because he thought they would have a better chance of making it. Colin Allred of the Tennessee Titans watches the action from the sideline during a preseason game on August 11, 2007 at LP Field in Nashville, Tennessee. READ: Legacy of MLK\\'s \\'I have a dream\\' speech becomes a nightmare for Atlanta sports team ownerIn the 2006 NFL Draft, Allred was overlooked and undrafted, but was subsequently picked up by the Titans and stayed there for five years.   Recalling his time in Tennessee, it\\'s clear that the pressure and expectation prepared him well for a life after sport. \"I learned how to grind it out,\" he explained, \"how to really focus every single day on accomplishing the task ahead of me.\" Allred had to fight for every single year in the squad: \"You may have 10 to 12 linebackers who are there, but there\\'s only going to be five or six who are going to make the final roster. \"You\\'re going to have to compete with those guys, but you\\'re also going to have to work with them because you\\'re going to be part of a union, a unit. \"I was always being challenged by a new draft pick, a younger, cheaper player coming in or a free agent who was maybe expected to take my position,\" he remembered, noting that a professional team athlete is expected to be both selfless and ruthless in equal measure. \"I always took the attitude that I\\'m going to compete with these guys, I\\'m even going to teach them how to play my role, but in the end -- I\\'m going to beat them out.\"   After a neck injury forced his early retirement, Allred got around to completing his law degree, then went to work in US President Barack Obama\\'s administration as a Special Assistant in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He was also among a group of Obama Administration and campaign alumni who heeded the call of the 44th President in his farewell address to \"Grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.\" Protesters break into the U.S. Capitol on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Allred must have felt like he was back in the Titans\\' locker room as he topped a crowded field of Democratic challengers in 2018, before gaining the nomination for Texas\\' 32nd Congressional district in a runoff and then finally beating the 11-term Republican incumbent Pete Sessions later that year. At the age of 35, Allred quickly realized that his first career had unwittingly prepared him for his second.  \"If you walk into any professional team\\'s locker room, you\\'ll find the strangest friendships,\" he told CNN. \"You\\'ll find folks from very different walks of life, who find a way to be friends, to work together. \"I wish that every member of a legislative body had to play team sports before they joined that legislative body, because you learn so much about how to interact with sometimes really difficult people and still work towards a common goal.\" The former NFL linebacker arrived back in Washington halfway through Trump\\'s presidential term, with the country riven by vicious and hyper-partisan politics. While it may appear that some lawmakers treat government like a game, Allred says there is a problem with making such a comparison these days. \"In sports,\" he observes, \"there is accountability. You can watch the film and see exactly what happened on any given play. You can say whose fault it was, why it did work or why it didn\\'t work and everyone on the team accepts that common set of facts. \"Unfortunately, in my experience, we have not had a common set of facts. We have not been able to agree on even just the problem before we start talking about the solution. I think it\\'s very difficult for democracies to function when you\\'re not agreeing on the facts.\" After the NFL, Allred became a voting rights lawyer and he is now deeply troubled by Republican-led proposed  legislation sweeping through state capitals all over the country that would make it much harder for many people to vote which critics say is targeted to suppress voting in minority communities.   \"What we\\'re going through right now is really unprecedented,\" Allred lamented. \"It\\'s something that we haven\\'t seen in the United States since the bad old days of Jim Crow discrimination, which was very explicit about who was and who wasn\\'t a full citizen. \"That\\'s how you lose your democracy that\\'s how you slip into something else. We have to make sure that the game is open to everyone.\" They used to say that \"sport and politics shouldn\\'t mix,\" that sports stars should \"stay in their lane,\" but that seems like a fanciful ideal today. As athletes have seen the communities they represent harassed and downtrodden, intimidated by police brutality and silenced by voter suppression, they\\'ve harnessed the power of their social media platforms and are no longer kowtowing to the call of \"shut up and dribble.\" They are silent no more.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party\\'s most extreme election ideas.First up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn\\'t like. In a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a \"12-committee lynching.\"Arizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take -- describing Bowers\\' takedown as \"killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.\"Read MoreThen came Rep. Mark Finchem\\'s resolution this month on Arizona\\'s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump\\'s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state\\'s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.Bowers\\' response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: \"Mr. Finchem\\'s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.\"Bowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history -- at least when it comes to some of his party\\'s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.He has described Trump and the then-President\\'s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.Bowers told CNN\\'s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. \"I said, \\'No, I won\\'t,\\'\" Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, \"\\'3.5 million people voted here, I\\'m not gonna unilaterally do that.\\'\"Bowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.Arizona at ground zeroEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.They include bills that would:Allow a third-party to scour the voter registration database for ineligible votersMake it a crime to misplace a ballotRestrict the use of ballot drop boxesMake it a felony for a public official to register someone to vote on the same day as election dayCreate a new election integrity unit to investigate voter fraudA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.Alex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with \"holding the line\" to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.But, he said, \"there are actually a lot of bad things\" moving through the legislature \"that people are being silent about.\"Dates to watchThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.Voters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov.

The biggest similarity was the high number of named storms. The 2021 season became only the third in history to use all of the names on the rotating seasonal list (the previous years were 2020 and 2005).We ended the season with 21 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). During an average year there would be 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. This year met or exceeded each of those categories, and it was forecast to be that way. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.There were four major hurricanes this season: Grace, Ida, Larry, and Sam. The strongest two were Ida and Sam, which both reached Category 4 strength. Grace and Larry peaked as Category 3 storms. The first half of the season was off to the races -- as the US was impacted by eight named storms: Claudette, Danny, Elsa, Fred, Henri, Ida, Mindy, and Nicholas.Read MoreThen, suddenly, the world\\'s oceans became eerily quiet. After September 25 the Atlantic and the rest of the world would struggle to produce a named storm.That was not what meteorologists expected.\"The globe has had no major (Category 3+, max winds >=111 mph) hurricane/typhoon/cyclone formations since September 25. All other hurricane seasons in the satellite era (since 1966) have had at least two global major hurricane formations between September 26 - November 19,\" Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University, said in a tweet.  Both last year and this year La Niña conditions were observed during the last several weeks of the season, which typically favors late season tropical activity. 2020 saw three named storms in November (Eta, Theta, and Iota) and 2021 saw just one (Wanda) during the first few days.How this hurricane season ended marks one of the biggest differences between this year and last.Klotzbach explained that usually La Niña weakens or limits vertical wind shear, but surprisingly there was quite elevated wind shear in the Caribbean in October and November -- the focal region for storms late in the season -- and that led to a quiet latter part of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.NOAA predicts 6th consecutive above-average hurricane seasonWhile an active season was predicted, it\\'s impossible to know in advance exactly where each storm will go and what kind of damage it may cause. A \"bad\" season is all about perspective. Central American countries may consider this to have been a \"good\" year since not a single named storm hit any part of the region. In 2020, Central America was hit by three named storms, two of which were major hurricanes. In the US, the state of Louisiana can\\'t seem to catch a break. In 2020, the Pelican State was impacted by five named storms: Cristobal, Laura, Marco, Delta and Zeta. This year the state was impacted by three named storms: Claudette, Ida and Nicholas.In 2020 more hurricanes made landfall in the US, but this year the storms cost over $20 billion more. Billions in damageWhile only one major hurricane made landfall across the US (Ida), a total of four named storms left behind over $1 billion in damage each: Tropical Storm Elsa, Tropical Storm Fred, Hurricane Ida, and Hurricane Nicholas.Ida alone exceeded the cost in damage of all seven billion-dollar tropical cyclones that made landfall across the US in 2020, including hurricanes like Laura, Delta, and Zeta.\"To date, Hurricane Ida is the costliest disaster this year -- exceeding $60 billion,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Ida already ranks among the top-five most costly hurricanes on record for the US since 1980.\"JUST WATCHEDThis Louisiana family lost their mom in Hurricane Ida.

Their disappointment was not at the contents of Biden\\'s address, but the America First optics of the leader of the free world washing his hands of a global problem. The unilateral decision to withdraw seemed to somewhat contradict Biden\\'s claim upon entering the White House that \"America is back.\"  A crisis like the one unfolding in Afghanistan has, for some, hammered home the bleak reality that, without America, Europe\\'s immediate ability to control its own destiny is limited. From London to Paris, Brussels to Berlin, the sudden fall of Kabul shone a light on Europe\\'s limited diplomatic heft, military capacity, and political stability. Diplomats and officials all over the continent have privately expressed their sorrow that this is where we are: If the US says it\\'s over, it\\'s over.  People wait to be evacuated from Afghanistan at the airport in Kabul on August 18, 2021 following the Taliban stunning takeover of the country.Read MoreWe know from comments made by Britain\\'s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, that he thought the withdrawal was a mistake and signaled victory to the Taliban. UK government officials told CNN they had tried to encourage both the Trump and Biden administrations to slow down, but failed to convince them.  Starkly, Wallace said in a recent interview to Sky News that when the US \"took that decision, the way we were all configured meant that we had to leave.\" Multiple European officials and diplomats told CNN of their shock at Biden\\'s assertion that the only US interest in Afghanistan was to neutralize the terrorists who attacked the US in 2001 and prevent further attacks on American soil.They now fear the humanitarian and political consequences of mass migration from a country run by militants who\\'ve historically harbored terrorists and that is connected to mainland Europe by land.  Without the might of America to keep a lid on the situation, Europe is undeniably more exposed. As one EU official put it: \"When America reversed course on Syria it sparked a crisis in Europe, not the US.\"  When former President Barack Obama U-turned on his decision to attack the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad following reports that he was gassing his own citizens, it had a knock-on effect still being felt today. Not only did millions of Syrians flock to Europe seeking refuge, but the vacuum left by America left room for terrorist groups to build bases from where they could launch and inspire attacks across the world. Geography and history suggest that once America is gone and the Taliban takes complete control of Afghanistan, ordinary citizens left behind who fear persecution will make every attempt to flee the country for somewhere safer.  Afghan people climb atop a plane as they wait at the Kabul airport in Kabul on August 16, 2021, after a stunningly swift end to Afghanistan\\'s 20-year war, as thousands of people mobbed the city\\'s airport trying to flee the group\\'s feared hardline brand of Islamist rule. That means Europe could soon see high volumes of migration from people seeking refuge, which, in turn, presents Europe -- the EU especially -- with a series of problems it could struggle to handle.  If the numbers fleeing Afghanistan look anything like the numbers that came from war-torn Syria in 2015, the EU essentially has two options: Pay off regional neighbors to hold the refugees or agree a quotas settlement across the 27-country bloc.Politically, the EU is not in a great place to reach any such agreement so is leaning toward the former. However, Brussels tried this back in 2015 when it gave Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\\'s government money to stem the flow of migrants into the bloc.  \"They\\'ve learned all the wrong lessons from 2015, where cutting a deal with Turkey backfired dramatically when President Erdogan decided it was politically convenient to use these people as weapons, letting them head for Greece,\" says Zoe Gardner, policy advisor at Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. The fact Erdogan was able to weaponize refugees was, Gardner says, a symptom of populist politicians treating people fleeing war zones as dangerous and something to fear.  \"It means people are inherently suspicious of them, so the starting point is people feeling negative about them. That often means they are treated poorly and makes governments take harder lines to keep them out. Which, sadly, means those determined to come are vulnerable to smugglers and people traffickers,\" she says.Tineke Strik, a member of the European Parliament\\'s committee on foreign affairs, is pessimistic at the political will in the bloc to reach an agreement. In turn, that likely means even worse conditions for these already vulnerable people.  Hungarian police officers face a group of Syrian migrants on the platform of the Kobanya-Kispest station, Budapest suburb, on September 2, 2015, as the refugees refused to board a train to the Debrecen camp. \"In so many member states there is an anti-refugee sentiment either in government or opposition. This turns not only political opponents against one another, but also nations who see political capital in taking a harder stance. In border countries, this could mean wire fences and tear gas aimed at people fleeing the most horrific conditions,\" she says.   EU officials are very aware of the myriad risks this anti-migrant sentiment poses.  Following the 2015 migrant crisis, far-right, Euroskeptic groups made significant political gains through anti-migrant and anti-EU rhetoric. So successful were some of these politicians, they shifted the political center ground. In France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark mainstream political parties now use the language of the far-right to protect their base. It helps the populist cause that historically both legal and illegal routes into Europe have been exploited by people seeking to carry out attacks in mainland Europe, though obviously these people represent a very small minority.The combination of security concerns, anti-migrant sentiment, anti-EU rhetoric and member states wanting to look tough makes life extremely difficult for Brussels, which fancies itself as a leading global promoter of human rights, freedom and democracy.  An EU Commission official explained to CNN that it wanted to carry on funding humanitarian projects in Afghanistan that supported human rights, women\\'s rights and upholding democracy, but that it would be a hard sell to member states now that America has bailed, and the Taliban is in charge. If suddenly member states are asked to host thousands of Afghan citizens, they might be even less understanding.  Beyond the EU, the crisis has exposed just how much Europeans relied on the might of American security through NATO.In this photo released by the White House, US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are briefed by their national security team on the evolving situation in Afghanistan on Wednesday, August 18.\"My fear is that if the world feels that it can no longer look with the same level of certainty and confidence to the US or NATO... we will see emboldened moves from actors hostile or unfriendly to a more united Europe,\" Roberta Metsola, a member of the European Parliament\\'s committee that works on migration and border security, tells CNN. \"That means that Europe must realize that the weight of the world democratic and security order rests more heavily on Europe\\'s shoulders. It is a wake-up call that we have snoozed too many times,\" she adds.Some are already calling for urgent action to address this. Tom Tugendhat, a British lawmaker who served in Afghanistan, spoke in a moving speech to the UK Parliament of a need for \"reinvigorating our European-NATO partners, to make sure that we are not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader... and make sure that we hold the line together.\" For Europe to reach the point Metsola and Tugendhat describe, there is a long path to walk. The UK, which has NATO\\'s second-largest military expenditure, felt it had no option but to follow the US out the door.  The EU has long talked about consolidating its military expenditure, but it\\'s an issue member states are so divided on that for Brussels to have anything like the power to plug the hole America\\'s left in Afghanistan would take decades.  Biden\\'s decision and lack of contrition has been criticized for many reasons. But perhaps the least palatable aspect of it is that America, bluntly, has the luxury of being able to leave in a way Europe -- and other regional neighbors -- cannot.  Tugendhat closed his speech on Wednesday by saying: \"This is what defeat looks like: When you no longer have a choice of how to help. This doesn\\'t need to be defeat -- but at the moment, it damn well feels like it.\" The free world, without its leader, is in no position to fix this mess and stand up for the values it holds so dear. And it\\'s certainly running low on choices of how to help. ',\n",

Omicron has left one person dead in the UK and prompted warnings it could surpass the Delta variant to become dominant in the country by Christmas. Johnson has told people to \"set aside\" the idea that the variant is mild.Britain battles Omicron \\'tidal wave\\' Britain\\'s beleaguered leader faced a major test of his authority on Tuesday, with members of his own Conservative party rebelling against measures on working from home, Covid passports and mask-wearing in a vote in Parliament. He was forced to rely on support from the opposition Labour Party to pass the new restrictions, which are a significant departure from the government\\'s pandemic response in recent months. Johnson lifted all Covid-19 rules on \"freedom day\" in July and has until now resisted the more robust mitigation measures imposed in parts of Europe, like vaccine passports and mask mandates. Read MoreThe Prime Minister is also embroiled in a scandal over reports that Downing Street held a number of staff holiday parties last winter, when the rest of the UK was living under strict rules banning social mixing. He has been forced to deny that he fast-tracked \"Plan B\" Covid rules in order to distract from his political woes.Opening the debate in Parliament on the new Covid regulations Tuesday, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that though the measures were not ones he would like to put in place, the situation demanded them. \"As we look ahead to a winter with Omicron in the midst, the measures before the House [of Commons] today will fortify our natural defenses and guard the gains that we\\'ve all made against this deadly virus,\" Javid said.Scientists have never seen a variant that can spread so quickly and the growth in cases of Omicron in the UK is now mirroring the rapid increase in South Africa, Javid said, warning that the observed doubling time was two days. Until recently, ministers had said that cases were doubling every two to three days.So far, 10 people in England have been hospitalized with the variant, the health secretary said, warning that even if Omicron turned out to be less severe overall than the Delta variant, its greater transmissibility risks overwhelming the health service, which is already stretched to its limits.The health secretary added that there may now be as many as 200,000 Omicron infections a day -- a figure that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said was based on modeling -- with the strain accounting for 20% of cases in England.  Recent analysis by the UKHSA has shown that two doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provided lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection from Omicron when compared with the Delta variant, but effectiveness rose considerably in the period after a booster dose -- 70% to 75% protection against mild disease.Javid described the \"national mission\" to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, calling it \"a race between the virus and the vaccine.\"The British government has insisted that its new booster drive, which aims to deliver third doses to every adult by the end of December -- a month earlier than planned -- is the best way to stop the spread of cases and avoid imposing further restrictions.  NHS staff are being redeployed to accelerate the booster vaccination effort, postponing some urgent appointments and elective surgeries until the new year to prioritize third shots.More than 500,000 booster and third doses were deployed on Monday, according to government data. Around 45% of people aged 18 and over are now estimated to have received a third dose, according to analysis by the PA Media news agency.Commuters at London\\'s Kings Cross station after the return of the mask mandate.But on the same day, the NHS booking system did not appear to be coping with the huge surge in demand for appointments. More than 100,000 people in England booked booster doses overnight, chief executive of NHS England Amanda Pritchard said on Monday. Responding to reports of the website crashing Monday morning, Pritchard acknowledged there had been \"some glitches on the system.\"But Pritchard asked members of the public to keep trying, stressing that \"more slots are going on all the time.\" She also asked those living close to walk-in clinics to make use of this facility if possible, despite people reporting having to queue up in the street for up to five hours.The British Medical Association (BMA) has also warned that the vaccination campaign will not be enough to stop the spread of Omicron, with an estimated one in four people not eligible for boosters due to being unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated. The BMA has called for a return of face masks to pubs and restaurants, as well as 2-meter social distancing in all indoor settings. \"Despite describing the current situation as an \\'emergency\\' with a \\'tidal wave\\' of infections on the horizon, the Government\\'s response relying entirely on the vaccine booster programme is missing the wider measures required to control the spread of Omicron,\" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said in a statement on Monday.Omicron is spreading fast. That\\'s alarming even if it\\'s mildOther measures debated Tuesday included government plans to introduce Covid passes to enter large venues such as nightclubs. The government has shifted the proposal to allow for the inclusion of a negative lateral flow test, in an attempt to assuage potential rebels. Javid said that there would always be an option for lateral flow tests, and he would not support a vaccine-only Covid pass system.The government has also advised fully vaccinated contacts of a Covid-19 case to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days to slow the spread of the virus.But the UK\\'s supply of home testing kits -- usually available to be ordered from the government\\'s website -- also appeared to run dry on Monday. Users in England logging on on Monday received a message saying \"sorry there are no more tests available,\" asking them to \"try again later.\"CNN\\'s Sarah Dean, Niamh Kennedy and Vasco Cotovio in London contributed to this report.',\n",

They focus on what a 2-degree world might look like.CNN kicked off this effort with a Facebook chat last week. We asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold, specifically.I don\\'t have all the answers right now. We\\'ll continue to explore the importance of this number together. But below you\\'ll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number. Many of them come straight from you, the readers. And I tossed in a couple of my own. If you\\'d like to follow this project as it evolves, I\\'d encourage you to sign up for the \"2 degrees\" newsletter. And feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below. They\\'ll shape the way I spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number.1. Where did the idea for 2 degrees come from? One guy, it turns out. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale. Nordhaus, 73, proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 (1977!) paper titled \"Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem.\" The estimate was \"crude, but it was a reasonable first start,\" he told me. \"If there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature, this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years,\" he wrote in \"The Climate Casino.\"A growing body of research now supports the idea.2. How did 2 degrees become the international standard?Science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming. And that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want. \"You need a judgment call for these things,\" said Carlo Jaeger, chair of the Global Climate Forum, who has written on the history of 2 degrees Celsius. \"And this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy.\"Germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal, Jaeger told me. That happened in the 1990s. Later came the European Commission, the G8, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and, most significantly, the Copenhagen Accord, which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much.The United States was among the signatories. 3. What would the world look like at 2 degrees?I\\'m going to spend the month of May exploring this question, so look for more on this. But here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like. These are pulled from reports by the National Research Council,  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Bank. • Wildfires in the United States are expected to increase 400% to 800% in size. • Hurricanes are expected to become 2% to 8% more intense.• A range of species will be at risk for extinction, particularly amphibians. The IPCC estimates 20% to 30% of animals and plants species will be at \"increasingly high risk of extinction\" at or near the 2-degree mark.• The Arctic is expected keep melting, losing 30% of its annual average sea ice.• Certain crop yields in the United States, India and Africa are expected to decrease 10% to 30%.• The availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20%. So ... not good.And numbers don\\'t convey the emotional toll.\"I\\'m from New Mexico,\" said Nordhaus, the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold. \"I love it there, and I know it\\'s going to be a completely different climate. The trout fishing probably won\\'t be as good. The hiking won\\'t be as good. These forests may look completely different, or burn down. I love to ski. It\\'s one of my things I love most. And that\\'s obviously affected by warming. I love the ocean, and the New England coastline, and it\\'s in peril. That\\'s just for starters.\"4. What happens at 2.1 degrees? No one knows, exactly. Think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech, told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking. How many cigarettes give you cancer? No one knows, exactly. But the more you smoke, the more you up your risk. And 2 degrees, policy experts agree, is certainly risky territory.Plus, everyone hates a fraction. Targeting 1 degree of warming is \"ridiculous because you can\\'t do it,\" said Nordhaus, the economist. \"Three sounds too high. And you can\\'t have a fraction because it\\'s too complicated. \"So two is kind of an obvious number.\"5. How much has the climate warmed already? The climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the Industrial Revolution. And we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we\\'re already putting into the atmosphere, even with \"very ambitious mitigation action\" to reduce carbon emissions, according to a 2014 report from the World Bank. Some of that warming is \"locked-in to the Earth\\'s atmospheric system,\" that organization says. The impacts of climate change already are being felt. 6. Is it possible to stay below 2 degrees?Yes, but it won\\'t be easy.\"If you want to stay below 2 degrees, you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree,\" said Jaeger from the Global Climate Forum. Here\\'s the best guess for what that \"amazing speed\" might need to look like: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80% to 90% by 2050, said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. \"It depends on how much risk you want to accept,\" she said. Some activists, including those from 350.org and Avaaz, which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in New York, want to accept less risk than that. \"Our position is 100% clean energy,\" said David Sievers, a senior campaigner for Avaaz.7. What happens if we don\\'t take action? If we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate, we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury. Scarier still, we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100.Some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target, saying it\\'s too ambitious, or even naive. But we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that \"north star\" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem.If you think 2 degrees sounds bad, 5 degrees is far, far worse. The IPCC expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by \"major extinctions around the globe\" and a \"reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide.\" Just beyond that, at 6 degrees, we\\'re looking a \"catastro-f***\" that would be almost \"infinitely costly,\" said Wagner, the Environmental Defense Fund economist. \"It\\'s akin to killing the planet, basically. Or society on the planet.\"This much should be clear: Something has to change.If we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3, that\\'s still better (or less awful) than 5 or 6. What\\'s important is that we maintain a sense of urgency, and keep sight of the goal.

Invasive species such as the bark beetle, which thrive in warmer temperatures, have attacked trees across the North American west, from Mexico to the Yukon. University of Colorado researchers have found that some populations of mountain pine beetles now produce two generations per year, dramatically boosting the bugs\\' threat to lodgepole and ponderosa pines.

One, this golden toad of Costa Rica and other Central American countries, has already gone extinct.Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: Effects of global warming around the worldAnimal migration – It\\'s not your imagination: Some animals -- mostly birds -- are migrating earlier and earlier every year because of warming global temperatures. Scholars from the University of East Anglia found that Icelandic black-tailed godwits have advanced their migration by two weeks over the past two decades. Researchers also have found that many species are migrating to higher elevations as temperatures climb.Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: Effects of global warming around the worldExtreme weather – The planet could see as many as 20 more hurricanes and tropical storms each year by the end of the century because of climate change, according to a 2013 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Now a study published in journal the Scientific Reports suggests that male sea snakes may think divers are potential rivals or mates, while female snakes think they are possible hiding places.The study uses data collected by co-author Tim Lynch describing encounters with olive sea snakes in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, from 1994-95. In 74 of 158 encounters sea snakes approached Lynch, and this was more common in the May-August mating season.Read MoreDuring this period male sea snakes look for females and start courting them as soon as they see them, study co-author Rick Shine, professor of biological sciences at Macquarie University, Sydney, told CNN.Olive sea snakes are abundant around certain coral reef areas.This largely involves flicking the female\\'s body with his tongue to check the chemicals on her skin to make sure she is the right species and sex, added Shine.\"Then aligning his body with hers, maybe wrapping coils around her to hold her in place so he can position himself for copulation,\" said Shine. \"But females often aren\\'t interested, so they zoom away and hide in the coral.\"Male sea snakes were more likely than females to approach divers, particularly during mating season, according to the study.In some cases they would flick their tongue at the diver, and in 13 cases they charged at the diver. When a male sea snake charged the diver it came straight after an unsuccessful chase of a female, or following an interaction with a rival male.Charges by females were observed after they had been chased by males, or had interacted with the diver before losing sight of him.Snorkeling grandmothers reveal large deadly sea snake population in popular bayIn three cases male sea snakes coiled around the diver\\'s fin, which is normally observed during courtship.\"These patterns suggest that \\'attacks\\' by sea snakes on humans result from mistaken identity during sexual interactions,\" reads the study.Sea snakes may find it difficult to identify shapes under water, according to previous research. \"Like dogs, snakes mostly rely on scent, not vision, to work out what\\'s going on in the world around them,\" said Shine, who explained that they use the tip of their tongue to take in scent cues that they then analyze using a special organ in the roof of the mouth.Large sea snakes are potentially deadly to humans, said Shine.\"Having a giant snake hurtle towards you and start checking you out can be life-threatening even if the snake doesn\\'t try to bite you,\" he added. \"Panic is deadly.\"The team suggests that divers should stay still and let the sea snake investigate them using its tongue.\"Our study shows that keeping calm is the key.

In a speech at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, west London, Kerry called for more ambitious emissions reduction pledges, saying that even if all countries delivered on their commitments to the Paris Agreement, global average temperatures would still rise by 2.5 or 3 degrees Celsius (4.5 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), or even more.\"We are forewarned -- everything the scientists have been telling us will happen for 30 years now, is happening -- but bigger and faster than predicted,\" he said.Making a comparison with World War II, Kerry called for the same show of unity that followed the six-year conflict and established a new world order. Scientists are worried by how fast the climate crisis has amplified extreme weather\"That journey has always given me a bedrock confidence that we can solve humanity\\'s biggest threats together.

Because time is running out. Not a euphemism, not an exaggeration. Time is running out.\"The Earth is already, on average, 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, and if it exceeds a 1.5-degree threshold, scientists say millions more people will be at risk of extreme heatwaves, drought and flooding.

In Germany, where more than 160 people have died in recent floods, Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the same message over the weekend -- that the world needs to speed up its response to climate change. Some scientists are also saying that recent extreme weather events indicate a faster impact of climate change than projected. Kerry calls on China to step upWhile using his speech to call for a unified global approach, Kerry added that, \"Mother Nature does not pick and choose which country\\'s emissions are warming the planet,\" and called on nations to engage with China, the world\\'s biggest polluter, to tackle the climate crisis collectively.  \"What matters is our collective fate,\" Kerry said. \"To those who say we should avoid engaging with China on climate change because of our differences, I say there is simply no way -- mathematical or ideological -- to solve the climate crisis without the full cooperation and leadership of a country today that leads the world with 28% of global emissions.\" Biden to focus on Covid-19, infrastructure, climate and cybersecurity at Cabinet meetingPresident Xi Jinping vowed to make his country carbon neutral by 2060 last September. But Kerry cited data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that suggests China\\'s contribution to global emissions will derail the ambitions of the Paris climate agreement. \"If China sticks with its current plan and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world would have to go to zero -- zero! -- by 2040 or even 2035,\" Kerry said. \"It knocks at least a decade off the timeline for the rest of the world to decarbonize. And that, my friends, sets a goal that currently is impossible to achieve,\" he continued. Kerry added that China\\'s \"unprecedented economic growth\" had been underpinned by a \"staggering\" amount of fossil fuel use and Beijing could help spearhead endeavors to reduce global emissions. \"And as a large country, an economic leader, and now the largest driver of climate change, China absolutely can help lead the world to success by peaking and starting to reduce emissions early during this critical decade of 2020 to 2030.\"Kerry also acknowledged that the world didn\\'t need any new investment in oil, coal or gas production to meet energy needs, and called out countries opening up new coal mines. The UK is one country that has such plans.\"By 2040, we should have entirely phased out all unabated coal and oil power plants and sharply reduced reliance on unabated natural gas generation,\" he said. But Joe Biden\\'s administration has also come under criticism for issuing a high number of permits for oil and gas drilling on public and tribal lands. The roadmapTo end his speech, Kerry laid out a global to-do list, based on scientific advice, including cutting global emissions by at least 45% by 2030, to put the world on a path to net zero by the mid-century. \"That makes this a decisive decade. And it makes 2021 a decisive year,\" he said.Net zero refers to a state where the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere is no greater than the amount removed by natural carbon sinks, like forests, or technology that removes carbon from the source or atmosphere, known as carbon capture.  By 2030, the world must speed up its use of clean technologies, Kerry said, and pointed to IEA assessments to put in perspective what exactly is required to meet net zero: building the equivalent of the world\\'s biggest solar plant every day for the next decade; quadrupling that use of wind and solar every year to 2030; and ensuring 60% of new car sales in 2030 are electric vehicles, among other measures.Green energy must be scaled up rapidly for heavy industry, shipping and aviation in particular. \"A raft of other technologies -- spanning advanced renewables and nuclear, long-duration energy storage, smart grids, and direct air capture -- will all need to be commercialized and scaled. This is even more of a challenge,\" he said.Kerry will travel to Rome on Wednesday and will return to London on Friday for a ministerial meeting over the weekend in the lead-up to COP26, which is starting on October 31.',\n",

The UK government\\'s scientific advisers were meeting Thursday to discuss the variant amid growing concerns it could jeopardize England\\'s plan to lift all legal limits on social contact from June 21.  Johnson said he remained \"cautiously optimistic\" about England\\'s plan to drop restrictions but that his government was \"ruling nothing out.\"The variant, known as B.1.617, appears to be fueling a crippling second Covid-19 wave in India and has now spread to more than 40 countries, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO declared B.1.617 a \"variant of concern\" this week and said some evidence suggests it may be more transmissible than other strains. The UK has reported more cases of B.1.617 and its sublineages than any other country outside India, according to the WHO.Here\\'s what\\'s known about the coronavirus variantsRead MoreOn Thursday, Public Health England said cases of the variant had increased from 520 to 1,313 in the past week. The variant has spread most across the northwest and in London, where measures such as mobile testing, door to door testing and vaccine buses were being deployed, PHE said in a statement. In areas most affected, health authorities said they planned to implement \"additional control measures\" including rapid testing and tracing in areas where there is increased spread. \"We need to act collectively and responsibly to ensure that variants do not impact on the progress we have all made to drive down levels of Covid-19 and the increased freedom that brings,\" Dr. Susan Hopkins, Covid-19 Strategic Response Director at PHE, said in the statement England enters phase two of its plan to lift restrictions on Monday, under which indoor dining will re-open.\"At the moment there\\'s a very wide range of scientific opinion about what could happen, but we want to make sure that we take all the prudential, all the cautious steps now that we could take,\" Johnson said. \"There\\'s a range of things that we could do, we\\'re ruling nothing out.\"Johnson promised \"you\\'ll be hearing a lot more before the end of the month, about what the world will exactly look like from June 21st\".\"But as I\\'ve said before, I am cautiously optimistic about that. And provided this Indian variant -- B.1.617.2 --  doesn\\'t take off in the way that some people fear, I think certainly things could get back much, much closer to normality.\"UK minister James Cleverly said the government is waiting to take decisions \"based on the data and the evidence\" provided by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE). \"The Prime Minister, the Health Secretary has always been clear that the easing of restrictions which allow us to get back to normality will be done at a pace and in a way which is safe, and we will always be driven by the data,\" he told Sky News earlier Thursday.',\n",

But after almost 16 years in the top job, she will step down once it becomes clear who her successor will be.The closeness of the race coupled with Germany\\'s complicated voting system means it could take some time before a winning coalition is formed and the ultimate victor is known.Germany is the biggest economy in Europe. What if it shifts left?Environmental concerns and economic worries have emerged as key issues in campaigning, with the former fueled by the deadly floods that devastated parts of Germany this summer.Read MoreThe SPD and CDU, the two largest parties in German politics, have been sharing power under Merkel\\'s fourth term as chancellor.CDU leader Armin Laschet, the party\\'s candidate to be the next chancellor and premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, held a final campaign rally with Merkel in Aachen on Saturday.A boy presented Merkel, 67, with a gingerbread heart iced with the words \"Thanks CDU,\" and another supporter gave her a cake decorated with a picture of her trademark rhombus hand gesture.Addressing the crowds, Merkel said Sunday\\'s election was all about Germany remaining \"stable\" and ensuring \"that the youth have a future and we can live in prosperity.\" She added that Laschet had shown throughout his political life that he could pursue it \"with passion and heart.\" Olaf Scholz, German finance and SPD candidate for chancellor in the federal election, speaks at a campaign event in his constituency in Potsdam on Saturday.Rival candidate Olaf Scholz, from the Social Democrats, held his last rally Saturday in his constituency in Potsdam. Scholz has been serving as the vice-chancellor and German finance minister since 2018.Scholz told supporters that if elected, he wanted to agree an increase in the minimum wage to 12 euro ($14) an hour within the first year of government. \"I want to achieve that those who work so hard, and earn little, have it a little better,\" he said.Scholz also referenced the concerns many voters have over climate change. Many young people demonstrated Friday, he said, \"and they put their fingers in a wound that is real -- because global climate change has to be stopped and we have to make our contribution here in Germany to make that happen.\"Sleeping Beauty\\'s forest is dying. It\\'s not the only climate crisis facing Germany\\'s next chancellorFDP leader Christian Lindner was to end his election campaign with rallies in Cologne and Düsseldorf.According to the latest polls, the Social Democrats are polling at 25.2% and could gain 4.7 percentage points compared to the 2017 national elections. This lead could mean a reversal of a 20-year-long downward trend for the Social Democrats. Over the past two decades, the party has lost around half of its voters.The Christian Democrats are trailing several percentage points behind the SPD at around 22.4%, polls indicate. This could mean a loss of 10.5 percentage points compared to the 2017 national elections, and of 19.1 percentage points compared to the 2013 elections.The Greens are currently polling at 15.9%, in third place. However, the ecological party could record the strongest growth of all parties in the next federal election, with a potential gain of 7.5 percentage points compared to the last national elections in 2017. The Greens\\' leader, Annalena Baerbock, has emerged as a contender for chancellor and potential kingmaker in the coalition negotiations expected to follow Sunday\\'s vote.Germany\\'s business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP) is polling at 11.1% and is slated to make only marginal gains compared to the last national elections, according to poll predictions.The far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is polling at 10.6% -- a decrease of 2 percentage points compared to the 2017 national elections. The AfD -- which saw a marked success in the 2017 elections following the influx of refugees into Germany in 2015 -- has struggled to keep its momentum going since and has faced harsh criticism over ties to the extreme far-right.',\n",

Neither were the Raiders. In fact, the questionable emails were uncovered as part of a league investigation into workplace misconduct at the Washington Football Team (WFT), which is concerning to many observers, given the modern National Football League\\'s efforts to become more inclusive and diverse. \"The question we should be asking is not really [about] the existence of the e-mails, but what is the culture in the NFL, period,\" said Jemelle Hill, a contributing writer for The Atlantic.\"And this culture has existed since the very inception of the NFL... It\\'s about all the people he was emailing. And people realize that he was emailing back and forth... So if this is the pervasive attitude, if this is the group think in the NFL, Black people don\\'t have a chance of being in leadership in the NFL at all because this is not just about Jon Gruden.\"Read MoreRaiders general manager Mike Mayock on Wednesday reminded reporters of the franchise\\'s long history of inclusion.  \"The way I grew up the Raiders always stood for diversity,\" he said, referring to the leadership of the late Al Davis, the former owner.  \"They had the first Latino quarterback, Tom Flores. He also became the second Latino head coach. The first African American head coach was Art Shell. The first female CEO was Amy Trask.\" Mayock said Davis\\' son and current owner, Mark, has been through a \"tough week\" but that Mark Davis -- during the general manager\\'s three-year tenure -- has \"preached\" for diversity and social justice and against domestic violence. On Tuesday, the attorneys for 40 former Washington Football Team employees whose complaints prompted the league investigation called for the full disclosure of the NFL\\'s findings. \"It is truly outrageous that after the NFL\\'s 10-month-long investigation involving hundreds of witnesses and 650,000 documents related to the longtime culture of harassment and abuse at the Washington Football Team, the only person to be held accountable and lose their job is the coach of the Las Vegas Raiders,\" the attorneys, Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, said in a statement.\"If the NFL felt it appropriate to release these offensive emails from Jon Gruden ... it must also release the findings related to the actual target of that investigation. Our clients and the public at large deserve transparency and accountability. If not, the NFL and Roger Goodell must explain why they appear intent on protecting the Washington Football Team and owner Dan Snyder at all costs.\"The league investigation said Snyder was responsible for the club\\'s unprofessional and intimidating culture, and failed to establish a respectful work environment. League spokesman Brian McCarthy said Wednesday that no more investigation details would be released for confidentiality reasons. Critics had called for Gruden, who had coached the Raiders since the beginning of the 2018 season, to be fired since The Wall Street Journal reported Friday he used racially insensitive language to describe NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith in a 2011 email.On Monday, the New York Times reported it reviewed more emails and found Gruden denounced women being employed as on-field officials, a team drafting an openly gay player, and the tolerance for national anthem protesters.Many of the emails, covering a seven-year period, were sent to Bruce Allen, the Washington team\\'s then-president, who was fired in December 2019, according to the Times.A league source confirmed the accuracy of the Times\\' story to CNN.Gruden had sent the emails while he worked as an ESPN analyst.The emails were uncovered by the league and presented to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week, the source said. The league last week sent the emails to the Raiders and said it had been waiting for the team to review them with Gruden.\"I love the Raiders and do not want to be a distraction. Thank you to all the players, coaches, staff, and fans of Raider Nation. I\\'m sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone,\" Gruden said in a statement issued by the Raiders on Monday.In one message, Gruden called NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a \"p*ssy\" and a \"f*ggot,\" according to the Times. In another, he called Michael Sam a \"queer\" after the player was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in 2014, and Gruden said the league should not have pressured the team\\'s then coach to draft Sam, the Times reported.Michael Sam publicly revealed he was gay ahead of the draft; he ultimately never played a regular season game in the league.JUST WATCHEDNFL veteran Ryan Russell says Jon Gruden\\'s resignation is not enoughReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNFL veteran Ryan Russell says Jon Gruden\\'s resignation is not enough 04:31NFL veteran Ryan Russell, who came out as bisexual in 2019, told CNN\\'s \"New Day\" league efforts to make the sport more inclusive should not stop with Gruden\\'s resignation. \"Jon Gruden wasn\\'t sending those emails to himself. There were other people that knew about it,\" Russell said. \"There were other people that were involved across the league and this went unchecked for years, so no, resigning is not accountability. It\\'s not enough.\"NFL reporter Ian Rapoport said Gruden lost credibility within the Raiders locker room, especially given Carl Nassib -- who became the first active NFL player in league history to announce he is gay earlier this year -- plays for Las Vegas. JUST WATCHED\\'It could not work\\': Ian Rapoport on Jon Gruden situationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\\'It could not work\\': Ian Rapoport on Jon Gruden situation 04:01Mayock said Wednesday that he met with Nassib and the player had requested the day off. \"He just said he\\'s got a lot to process,\" the general manager said of Nassib. \"There\\'s a lot that\\'s been going on the last few days and, of course. we support that request.\" The fact thousands of emails from the investigation have yet to be made public has many league observers asking who else will be exposed. \"It\\'s a safe assumption to say that there are a lot of Jon Grudens in the NFL  and I guess I just don\\'t have the confidence that this league can really put itself in self-check because this is the same league that wants people to buy that they are invested in attacking this issue because they have \\'End Racism\\' end in end zones, because they have committed to social justice work,\" Hill said.In July, the NFL announced it fined the WFT $10 million after an independent investigation found the club\\'s work environment was \"highly unprofessional,\" especially for women. The fine comes after 15 former female employees and two journalists who covered the team accused team staffers of sexual harassment and verbal abuse. The WFT launched an investigation last July, which the NFL took over in August.The league pledged the $10 million will be used to \"support organizations committed to character education, anti-bullying, healthy relationships and related topics.\"The NFL will also use the money to fund programs aimed at improving the workplace for women and underrepresented groups, according to a statement. Gruden\\'s emails were uncovered as part of that investigation. CNN\\'s Homero De La Fuente, Steve Almasy, Kevin Dotson, David Close, Jill Martin, and Ben Church contributed. ',\n",

Our imperiled democracy - CNN The Capitol insurrection — and the egregious attempts by one party first to blow up the peaceful transfer of power, the bedrock of our democracy, and then to make several attempts to ensure no election would ever again deny them power — has sweeping implications for the future.  perspectives, Opinion: The biggest news story of 2021? Our imperiled democracy - CNN The biggest news story of 2021? Our imperiled democracy Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN, covered the television industry for The New York Times for 25 years, and has written four books on TV, including The Late Shift and The War for Late Night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Tis the season; but there aren\\'t many reasons to be jolly.The pandemic is back, not that it ever really left. Headlines are again dominated by explosively rising case numbers, which means equally rising levels of depression and panic. Covid is a news story so inescapable it swallows up the attention of the nation.And yet, in lists of the biggest news stories of 2021 that media organizations are composing, while Covid is huge, the ongoing challenge to American democracy is a constant. The headlines began in January with the first serious attempted coup in US history and have been running ever since, highlighted by the unceasing machinations by supporters of Donald Trump to either restore him to office or find some extra-legal way to eliminate the possibility he could ever lose if he ran again. Indeed, as much as the Covid crisis has affected our nation, I have no hesitation in arguing that the story of our imperiled democracy is the biggest story of the year — a story unlike any we have seen before in the United States. The Capitol insurrection — and the egregious attempts by one party first to blow up the peaceful transfer of power, the bedrock of our democracy, and then to make several attempts to ensure no election would ever again deny them power — has sweeping implications for the future. I certainly don\\'t believe I have seen any other news story in my own lifetime, which goes back to the 1950s, that has shaken the nation to its foundations as this one has. Read MoreThe country has been buffeted by tragic and frightening stories throughout the decades I have followed the news, starting, in my own experience, with the John F. Kennedy assassination. The shooting of JFK certainly seemed like a thunderbolt hurled at the heart of our government — with all kinds of disorienting details, including the accused assassin being murdered live on television, then the immediate and persistent conspiracy theories that ran rampant. A terrible time for sure.Next: the escalation of the Vietnam War, which ran parallel to the struggle of the Civil Rights movement and made the \\'60s the most divisive time in my early life.The \\'70s brought Watergate, which was supposed to be the biggest political scandal of our history.On through the many tragic and disturbing mass shootings, especially the horrific killings of schoolchildren. Then the terrifying morning of 9/11, an event that did unite the nation — in overpowering grief.Nothing can diminish the staggering impact of these events, and their ripple effects through the consciousness of Americans. But the moment we are at right now feels different, eerie almost, like the stillness that presages a coming storm of a magnitude we can\\'t yet measure. The reason \\'SNL\\' is so hilarious again? Less TrumpAll of those earlier crises brought shock, horror and terrible sadness. But the state of the nation always remained stable. Maybe only two events before my time, the Civil War and World War II, are legitimate rivals to our current crisis in terms of potential destructive impact. In both those earlier cases, our democracy also came under mortal threat, once from internal forces, once external. Both encompassed authoritarianism, violent threats to opponents, popular appeal based on rage and grievances, a cult following and very big lies. And, in both those past crises, our democracy still survived.Bloodshed on the scale seen during those two wars is unlikely now; but democracy\\'s survival is no sure bet. Mainly that\\'s because the truth of the threat is being either abused or obscured. For the first time, a group trying to unravel democracy has its own media megaphone to blast out propagandistic disinformation about the 2020 election, falsely claiming that it was stolen, despite an utter lack of evidence.Lies about the election have been thoroughly discredited already, in courts and endless \"audits.\" But pro-Trump Republicans continue to believe the fabrications, and worse, use them to install biased election officials and to enact laws that pave the way for them to overturn vote totals they don\\'t like — all accompanied by unceasing efforts to suppress or deny the vote to people who oppose them.That utterly unjustified and nefarious activity is the fuel stoking the drive to see the American experiment in a government of the people, for the people and by the people perish from the earth. This isn\\'t a case of over-the-top partisan politics gone a bit too far, where one side pushes this way and the other side pushes back. It\\'s a slowly unfolding horror movie; and yes, unless something changes the scary ending, it will certainly be the biggest news story of my lifetime.',\n",

At Bereman\\'s direction, the builders had the freedom to build whatever they wanted to, \"drawing out features from other action sports,\" he explains.The Californian has been riding motorcycles since he was barely more than a toddler, and this variation of the sport is one that he has helped to define.\"I grew up racing motorcycles, and racing supercross and motocross inside stadiums, and then ultimately got hurt too much and had to take a back seat on that,\" he explains. \"Obviously, in motocross, there\\'s freestyle, where they\\'re doing flips and tricks and all that stuff, and I kind of fell in between those two genres there. Ultimately, it\\'s what I would call Freeriding.\"Like back country snowboardingThere are parallels with both snowboarding and skating where Bereman has focused his career. \"The biggest thing I can relate it to, to the outside public, would be that there\\'s contest snowboarding and then, like, backcountry snowboarding, so riding the powder and the hills, and the same with street skating, there\\'s contest skating and then there\\'s street skating where people are just out on the streets and filming.\"To Bereman, freeriding is all about the pure freedom of riding. \"It\\'s having our own form of expression through our dirt bikes and just being able to go out there and have fun and find jumps and, ultimately, just be free on your dirt bike.\"Tyler Bereman, Josh Hill, Christian Dresser, Ryan Sipes, Tom Parsons getting ready for their runs at Imagination 2.The Red Bull Imagination events take this to the extreme. After the success of 2020\\'s debut, nine riders were gathered back in Fort Scott, Kansas for its 2021 successor -- where Bereman\\'s mind took the track to even wilder frontiers.\"We kind of ran out of time building everything we wanted [in 2020], so after year one, the course sat there and didn\\'t get touched for a year straight. The goal for year two was to come back in and just keep adding options and options and options to all the jumps, to more or less create a dirt skatepark.\"\\'Way bigger than I thought\\'One rider returning for more was Ryan Sipes, a flat track and supercross legend, and 2019\\'s International Six Days Enduro world champion.\"I thought I knew what to expect, when we got there in 2020, it was like, \\'Wow, this is so big, it\\'s so much bigger than anything I\\'ve ever seen,\\'\" the 37-year-old Sipes tells CNN Sport. \"So coming to this year, it\\'s kinda like, \\'We already know how big it was, how much bigger can they go?\\' Well, they went way bigger than I thought we could go.\"Ryan Sipes says he was attracted to Imagination by the allure of its novelty.Sipes says he was attracted to the Imagination event by the prospect of trying something new. \"I\\'ve been riding my whole life, since I was three years old, and to be able to learn something new and at the same time be able to compete with the best in the world, that\\'s just a cool challenge for me to take on and go, \\'Let me figure this out, let me go watch these guys, hang out with these guys.\\'\"But with his skills honed closer to the ground, he admits he worried about holding his own with riders used to outrageous tricks and jumps.\"I can\\'t do the tricks that they can do, I can\\'t backflip, I can\\'t even throw the whips the way they can,\" the veteran smiles. \"I just tried to make the coolest line that I could.\"Last year\\'s track was a track, it was, \\'Hey, you\\'re kinda going in this direction,\\' and you could vary it a little bit, but it was kinda like, this is the way you\\'re supposed to go,\" he continues. \"This year there was none of that, it was kind of, \\'There\\'s a bunch of jumps, and a couple of turns, and just figure it out, and do your own thing.\\'\"Big jumps bring high stakesAs the ramps and features of the track grew higher, so too did the stakes for the riders, and Bereman admits that safety was near the front of his mind.\"The sky\\'s the limit when it comes to creativity, but at the end of the day, with that creativity, safety is paramount,\" he says. \"Ultimately, what we do is not safe by any means, so that was the biggest thing, trying to make it as safe as possible, but obviously, just create new features and things that you\\'ve never really seen before.\"Sipes provided his fellow riders with the biggest heart-in-mouth moment when his bike mysteriously stalled in mid-air, forcing him to bail out mid-jump and hurtle to the ground, with his machine dangerously close behind him.Pecco Bagnaia: Wild wins, pop videos, and a famous mentor: why Italian is MotoGPs rising star\"It\\'s kind of the nightmare scenario, the jumps are so big, and it\\'s not just the distance, the height that you get off these jumps,\" Sipes explains. \"I think I\\'d be guessing on the low side when I say I was probably 35 feet off the ground on that jump, so that\\'s a long way to fall... it\\'s really far up, even to jump into water from that height is kind of scary.\"In that moment you have half a second probably to figure out whether you\\'re going to ride it out or jump -- and it\\'s not always best to jump, a lot of times it\\'s best to hang on -- but in that instance, I was like, \\'This bike\\'s going to just body slam me if I don\\'t get away from it.\\'\"Miraculously, he walked away largely unscathed. \"I was very sore and honestly pretty spooked by it, but we still had competition day, so I had to get back on it and go.\"\\'It\\'s a billboard, it\\'s 15 feet off the ground\\'Among the wilder parts of the track was a billboard that riders were using as a vertical touchpoint in mid-air. \"The wall ride was one of the crazy things. It\\'s a billboard, it\\'s 15 feet off the ground, it\\'s 15 feet tall, and then 25 feet long,\" Bereman recalls. \"That was pretty scary because that\\'s not something that we do every day.\"Sipes was full of admiration for Bereman\\'s skill. \"He\\'s one of the most talented guys I\\'ve ever seen on a motorcycle, and part of that is his ability to judge how fast to hit something when he\\'s never hit it before,\" he smiles, wide eyed.\"The wall ride was one of the crazy things ... That was pretty scary because that\\'s not something that we do every day.\"\"A lot these jumps there\\'s no halfway, it\\'s either go all the way or don\\'t even roll over it, and his ability to go, \\'I think I\\'ll hit it second gear and three-quarter throttle,\\' and he makes it, and it\\'s amazing to watch that.\"The Red Bull Imagination event was a competition, with riders judged for style by a watching jury. Axell Hodges was crowned the winner in the end, followed by fellow X-Games star Colby Raha and Bereman himself in third. But while competing was important, the consensus seemed to indicate a different kind of atmosphere.\"The vibe was amazing,\" Bereman grins. \"When it comes to racing or freestyle, you\\'re almost bred to beat your competitor; with freeriding, we\\'re kind of all in this together and we\\'re feeding off each other.\"\"It was the most fun week I\\'ve had on a dirt bike,\" Sipes concurs. \"I\\'ve been riding my whole life and I\\'ve done some really cool stuff, but fun factor-wise this takes the cake.\" For his part, Bereman is already thinking about next year\\'s event. \"This is a new lane in our sport,\" he says. \"It\\'s a work in progress, we\\'re learning as we go, and each year that we do it, we take things back that we learned that we could do better, then try to implement them the following year.\"Hopefully, if all goes well, we can come back with 3.0 and keep building.\"',\n",

The memory of that sign stayed with her. Six years later, at the age of 14, Peltier is fighting for water conservation and indigenous water rights. She says she was inspired by her great aunt, Josephine Mandamin, an indigenous activist who walked the shores of all five Great Lakes to raise awareness for water conservation.When she was 12, Peltier confronted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, telling him she was unhappy with his policies on controversial pipeline projects. Trudeau promised her he would protect the water. Since 2015, 87 long-term water advisories in Canada have been lifted; 56 water advisories remain.Last year, Peltier spoke at the UN about the importance of water conservation and water access, explaining the sacred role water plays in her culture. \"Many people don\\'t think water is alive or has a spirit.

LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said this ruling is \"really rubber-stamping voter disenfranchisement.\" \"But it\\'s not just about Alabama,\" Brown added. \"It has implications for voter protections around the country.\" What is redistricting?Felicia Scalzetti, a redistricting organizer for the Alabama Election Protection Network and the Ordinary People Society, told CNN, \"The problem with redistricting is that ... it changes who you can vote for.\"  \"You can encourage people to turn out all you want,\" Scalzetti said. \"But if the slate of people on the ballot do not actually represent your community because your community is cut six ways to Sunday, there\\'s no amount of turning out that\\'s going to fix that.\"  Redistricting is the process of reallocating congressional seats every 10 years based on population changes reflected in the US Census and then redrawing the boundaries of the congressional districts so each has an equal population.  In 35 states, the legislature has control over the redistricting process, which raises concerns about the incumbent party manipulating the process in its favor, also known as partisan gerrymandering. In this election cycle, 20 of the 35 states are controlled by Republicans, compared with 11 favoring Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Four states have divided governments.  \\'They know where Black voters live\\': Challengers say \\'race blind\\' redistricting maps are anything butSimilarly, redrawing in terms of race is known as racial gerrymandering. Since voters of color tend to favor Democrats, redistricting driven by party interests or fueled by racial motivation -- whether to curb voters of color or amplify their influence -- go hand in hand.  Alabama\\'s Republican-drawn map gives Black voters the majority in only one of seven districts despite them making up 27% of the population. Thus, the Alabama lawsuit argued that it had been drawn based on race, and used the \"cracking\" and \"packing\" tactics to specifically dilute the power of Black voters.  The map lumped areas with high concentrations of Black people together in one district where they could be the majority -- known as packing -- and split up other Black voters in the state so they remain a minority in all other districts -- known as cracking. It will remain in place for the state\\'s primaries in May. \\n\\n\"The thinking that we could just disenfranchise people at the state level is still here and it still operates a large part of the state\\'s attitude toward our voting structure,\" Dev Wakeley, policy analyst at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit public policy advocacy organization, told CNN.Wakeley and others say the map is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any practice that denies or curtails the right to vote based on race. The law included a provision that mandated states with a history of discriminatory practices, which included Alabama, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral practices, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.  In fact, a lower court unanimously ruled that the new congressional map violates the Voting Rights Act, and the three-judge panel -- which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump -- ordered the state to draw another district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it.  What the Supreme Court\\'s decision on Alabama\\'s maps could mean for the Voting Rights Act\"No one had any faith that the state of Alabama was going to have voters\\' best interests at heart,\" Wakeley said. \"We expected a little more of an attempt at a fig leaf by the Supreme Court.\"  But with a conservative majority and in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to stay in place while the case plays out, and experts say the highest court\\'s decision \"sends a very strong signal.\"  David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on redistricting, told CNN, \"It\\'ll be harder for states to follow what we thought was settled law when it comes to creating minority-majority districts or even influence districts.\"  \"It\\'s going to be more of an uphill climb now for anyone to win a voting rights challenge,\" he added. Similar battles nationwide \"The sort of anti-democratic ideas that have infested a lot of Alabama decision makers are much more widespread,\" Wakeley said.  \"While we might be the sort of sandbox where these terrible policies come into play,\" he added, \"we\\'re far from alone.\"  Other states have also been accused of intentionally suppressing the vote of communities of color in their redistricting plans.  A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting powerMark Gaber, who litigates redistricting cases for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNN, \"It just seems, you know, that wherever the folks in power want to retain their power, they\\'ll, you know, have no sort of shame about violating voting rights of minorities.\" The Campaign Legal Center is a non-profit legal advocacy organization that has filed lawsuits against multiple states for racial and partisan gerrymandering.  Texas faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the Biden administration in December, for its congressional map, which the Justice Department says does not reflect the state\\'s growth in minority population.  The state was awarded two additional congressional seats due to minority communities, who made up 95% of the state\\'s overall population growth, but the Justice Department said Texas had drawn the map in a way that the two new seats would be decided by  majority-White voting populations.  The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit against Georgia last month on behalf of multiple advocacy groups, saying the state\\'s new congressional map is \"its latest assault on the rights of Black voters and other voters of color to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and elect candidates of their choice.\"The lawsuit alleges that Georgia, similarly to Alabama, packed voters of color into one district and spread out remaining voters of color to ensure they are the voting minority in two other districts.  \"We\\'re in a very sort of unstable time in this landscape of voting rights law, and also just generally about elections in the country,\" Gaber said. \"And I think the last decade of experience in America proves that now more than ever we need protections for Black and Latino voters.\"  ',\n",

Several regional and municipal heads will also be elected.But Vishnevsky has said that two other Boris Vishnevskys are standing against him and have altered their appearance to look more like him, labeling the situation a \"scam\" in a Twitter post Sunday.

Until recently, the 59-year-old Viktor Bykov -- now Boris Ivanovich -- was Chief Assistant to Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Sergey Solovyev.On Monday, Vishnevsky filed an official complaint with the Central Election Committee chairperson, Ella Pamfilova, urging the body to hold an inspection and provide the information about the candidates\\' original names right below their new ones on the electoral posters at the territorial electoral commission centers.Pamfilova called such means of campaigning a \"mockery,\" but said that the law allows Boris Vishnevsky\\'s namesakes to run in the elections.Central Election Committee chairperson, Ella Pamfilova, said they do not have the legal means to dismiss the candidates.\"I think this is just a disgrace, an outrage.

       " 'Why chaos in eastern Europe is never bad news for Vladimir Putin - CNN Alarm bells are ringing in Europe\\'s halls of diplomacy. In recent days, senior Western officials have expressed their concern at the thousands of Russian forces that have appeared near the eastern borders of Ukraine. europe, Why chaos in eastern Europe is never bad news for Vladimir Putin - CNN Why chaos in eastern Europe is never bad news for Vladimir Putin  (CNN)Alarm bells are ringing in Europe\\'s halls of diplomacy. In recent days, senior Western officials have expressed their concern at the thousands of Russian forces that have appeared near the eastern borders of Ukraine.On Monday, NATO\\'s Secretary-General warned Moscow against \"potential aggressive actions\" after Ukrainian officials estimated there were 90,000 Russian troops \"near the border and in the temporarily occupied territories,\" as well as in the Black Sea.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that the US was \"concerned by reports of unusual Russian military activity\" and mentioned the possibility that Russia may be \"attempting to rehash\" its 2014 invasion of its neighbor. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Russia to \"adopt a posture of restraint\" because any attempt to \"undermine Ukraine\\'s territorial integrity would have serious consequences.\"The questions that require answers are: 1) How immediately dangerous is the situation; 2) What can the Western alliance do, if anything, to dissuade Russia from further provocation; and 3) What does the Russian President Vladimir Putin actually want? In private, European diplomats and officials answer these questions by saying they don\\'t believe the situation is the same as in 2014, when Russian operatives invaded Ukraine and annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. Armored personnel carriers take part in an amphibious landing exercise held by army corps and naval infantry units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at the Opuk range in Crimea in October 2021. Read MoreOrysia Lutsevych, a Ukrainian analyst at Chatham House, agrees. \"It\\'s the best war you can fight without boots hitting the ground. Unlike 2014 this is not about territory, but about undermining Ukraine\\'s persistent movement towards the West and telling the West that Russia has a legitimate presence in this region.\" However, those officials do fear that Putin has created something of a Catch-22 that he is very happy to exploit. Putin knows that if he builds up troops, the West has to respond. That means statements like the above from senior US, French, German and EU officials. The rub is that statements and other measures have not historically forced Putin\\'s hand. \"Russia has demonstrated many times that it is able to wait out sanctions,\" said Cathryn Cluver Ashbrook, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \"Putin knows that sanctions are difficult to sell to certain groups at home when they can indirectly impact German business or energy supplies in France,\" because companies cannot work with Russian companies.The Catch-22 is that Putin receives a legitimacy boost when these Western leaders are forced to talk with him in order to deescalate tense situations. \"Every time someone like Merkel is forced to pick up the phone and talk to him about preventing a crisis, he becomes simultaneously the cause and solution to the problem. It makes him seem very powerful at home and elsewhere in Europe,\" said a senior EU diplomat. There is another situation unfolding in Europe that could allow Putin to play both foe and friend. The border between Belarus and Poland is playing witness to a migration crisis that has been lurching toward violent escalation. On Tuesday morning, tensions erupted when migrants trying to gain entry to Europe threw rocks at Polish border guards, who responded with water cannons.Violence erupts on Poland-Belarus border as Polish guards fire water cannon on migrants throwing rocks  Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been accused of manufacturing the crisis by directing migrants from the Middle East and Asia to the border. A sudden influx to any country within the EU creates the real possibility of a political crisis and headache for Brussels. The nature of the EU\\'s internal borders mean that once you have entered a country like Poland, it becomes easier to move around within the bloc. This would almost certainly lead to member states turning on one another, sowing divisions within the bloc and undermining the EU\\'s unity -- something that makes Putin and Lukashenko very happy. To make matters more complicated, Poland is currently in a protracted spat with Brussels over Warsaw\\'s lack of compliance with EU law. A senior EU official explained to CNN that Poland was \"already using this crisis to argue for unity on the issue of migration. The problem is, solidarity on this will be taken by Poland as collaboration in their own rule-breaking that undermines the Union.\" While Putin has denied any involvement in this redirection of people, he has defended Lukashenko\\'s handling of the crisis. Russia is also Belarus\\' most important ally, helping keep Lukashenko -- a man often called Europe\\'s last dictator -- stay in power. Most analysts say it is extremely unlikely such a confrontational policy would have been carried out without at least consulting the Kremlin. This type of crisis allows Putin to enjoy supporting Lukashenko and stoking the fire, while also playing peacekeeper. If Putin made it clear he wanted Lukashenko to stop, it is almost certain he would.Vladimir Putin (R) meets with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi in May 2021.It\\'s not clear what Putin\\'s long-term plan is for either crisis. It is, however, a safe bet that the West looking disunited and impotent while its borders face being overrun is deemed good news for the Russian President, and the crisis will get steady coverage on Russian state TV. And the West has looked impotent in the face of Russian aggression many times over the past decade. \"The West\\'s diplomatic toolbox is depressingly empty when it comes to Russia,\" said global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw. Tensions are rising on the Poland-Belarus border. Here\\'s what you need to knowHe believes that the combination of American indifference, Europe\\'s cognitive dissonance on what it wants from Russia and Putin\\'s relative inability to do any real harm to the more powerful Western nations have left Putin with the impression that he can essentially do what he wants and get nothing more than harsh words. \"Lots of Eastern European nations are now terrified that the US and its closest allies are just not interested in foreign affairs any more, especially since the withdrawal from Afghanistan,\" Bociurkiw said. As serious as the situations in both Ukraine and Belarus are, it is entirely possible that they are easily explained as relatively weak leaders like Putin and Lukashenko flexing their muscles in parts of the world they know they can get away with it. Realistically, Putin simply is not a major threat to the West. The tragedy of that reality is that for those who live in his sphere of influence, a lack of pushback from the international community means that a man who despises playing by the rules has as good as absolute power over their lives. Whether that becomes a strong enough incentive for countries like the US, Germany, France and the UK to act, should the aggression get worse, is really anyone\\'s guess.',\n",

To test this, we exposed Whisky and Vicky Nina to the new words in two different conditions,\" Claudia Fugazza, first author of the study and a researcher at the department of ethology, said. Dogs likely migrated to the Americas with humans over 15,000 years ago, study saysOne scenario was an exclusion-based task, and another was within a social, playful context with their owners. Read More\"Importantly, in both conditions the dogs heard the name of the new toy only four times,\" Fugazza said.Presented with seven known toys and one new toy, the dogs were able to select the new toy when presented with a new name. Researchers say this proves that dogs can choose by exclusion -- when confronted with a new word, they selected and retrieved the only toy which did not have a known name.However, when researchers presented two newly named toys and asked them to retrieve one, they failed. Vicky Nina among her toys. While preliminary evidence seems to show that most dogs do not learn words (i.e. names of objects), unless eventually very extensively trained, a few individuals have shown some exceptional abilities.The research team also noticed that both dogs were able to identify and retrieve newly named toys after hearing the name only four times from their owners during play.\"Such rapid learning seems to be similar to the way human children acquire their vocabulary around 2-3 years of age,\" said Adam Miklósi, head of the Department of Ethology and co-author of the study.Analysis of ancient DNA reveals details about the dire wolf, inspiration for \\'Game of Thrones\\' creatureBut not all dogs learn words this way.In a test of 20 other dogs, researchers found that none of them learned the new toy names. It was concluded that, without formal training, the capacity to learn words rapidly is very rare and is only present in a few gifted dogs.Researchers also found that both Whisky and Vicky Nina forgot the new toy names quickly, and in some tests, within little over an hour of first learning them.The research was published Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports.Meanwhile, in spite of their \"human-like\" auditory capabilities for interpreting speech sounds, dogs do not hear the subtle differences between words in the way that humans do, a team of researchers from the same university reported last year.Dogs are renowned for their auditory capacity and their ability to hear words and sounds well and they are able to differentiate speech sounds. But experts said it seems they don\\'t pay attention to all of the speech sounds.Correction: A photo caption in an earlier version of this story misstated Whisky\\'s sex.

The Calabrian trial focuses primarily on just one group -- the Mancuso clan from the province of Vibo Valentia -- leaving much of the \\'Ndrangheta\\'s top hierarchy untouched.\"The road ahead is still very long, but we mustn\\'t give up because there are thousands of people who believe in us.

Now they are under a winter storm warning, with up to seven inches of snow expected by the end of the day. According to the NWS office in Baltimore, the area could see snowfall at one to three inches an hour in some locations, making travel difficult, and winds gusting as high as 30 mph will create blowing snow, making travel even more dangerous. Washington has been in a bit of a snow drought during the last few years. The last time DC had any measurable snow was February 2021, and it was only about half an inch. The last time they had more than 2.5\" of accumulating snow was in January 2019, more than a thousand days ago.It was the big snowfall dumping more than 10\" in and around the city. \"A dynamic low pressure system will be the fuel for significant weather impacts across parts of the Southeast coast and Mid-Atlantic over the next day or so,\" said the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).

Several inches of snow is forecast for the mid-Atlantic today, making it the first significant snow of the season.See how much snow is forecast for your area\"Heavy wet snow will also accumulate on power lines leading to power outages,\" said the WPC. This morning there were roughly 500 thousand people who already lost power, and the number will likely go up. Expect more disruption in travel as well. As the storm moves across the region, flights will be delayed or canceled. This will only put more strain on the airlines who are already canceling flights due to a shortage in staff because of Covid. Flights will also be disrupted because of the winds, which will gust between 40-45 mph in the Southeast through the day today. \"Refreezing of any melted snow tonight may produce additional hazardous travel conditions,\" said the WPC. It will make travel dangerous for Tuesday morning as well, long after the snow has ended. Lows will drop into the teens and 20s for much of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic tonight.

He\\'s jdsutter on Snapchat.Lexington, Texas (CNN)This is the story of a giant pile of beef.Well, 1.27 pounds (0.58 kilos) of brisket, to be exact.But before I get into the business of explaining where this meat came from, and why eating this stuff has a massive, unexpected effect on climate change, I feel the need to confess something: That huge slab of brisket, which came to me by way of Snow\\'s BBQ, a delightful shack of a place out here in the heart of Texas beef country, easily was one of the most food-orgasm-y things I\\'ve tasted. The phrase \"OHMYGOD\" dropped out of my mouth, involuntarily. And I don\\'t eat much meat. Read MoreA colleague of mine had a better line. \"I mean, f--- Al Gore, right?\"I write about climate change for a living and appreciate what the former U.S. vice president has done (or has tried to do, in his own wooden way) to raise awareness about what I consider to be one of the most critical issues facing the planet and people. But, in that moment, I had to laugh and agree with my co-worker.  Forget the climate.This stuff was too good.Here, take a look. Snow\\'s BBQ in Lexington, Texas, was rated the best barbecue in the state by Texas Monthly in 2008.Daniel Vaughn, BBQ editor at Texas Monthly, and the No.1 carnivore I know -- this is a man who has developed white bumps on his tongue, apparently from failing to eat nonmeat food groups -- helped me dissect the meal. Note the salt-and-pepper \"bark\" at the edge of the meat, the red tree rings where the smoke that cooks the beef, slowly, overnight, has left its artistic mark. The cloudlike strips of beef were so tender locals insist you peel them apart with your fingers, not a fork and knife.Knowing the beef\\'s backstory only adds to the experience. The barbecue \"pitmaster\" at Snow\\'s is 80-year-old Norma Frances Tomanetz. White hair, red apron. Everyone calls her \"Tootsie.\" Tootsie\\'s shift starts at 9 p.m. and ends the next day after about 600 pounds of beef have been served. Her recipe is simple: salt and pepper. And, in addition to working here -- again, at age 80 -- she also serves as a middle-school custodian, helps manage a cattle ranch and takes care of two sick family members. (They could use your prayers, by the way.)Texas beef people are lovably tough. You want to root for them. But there\\'s \"an inconvenient truth\" about beef consumption, too, as I would discover on a trip through the supply chain of that meal: Beef is awful for the climate. Don\\'t blame me alone for bearing the bad news. In a Facebook poll, thousands of you overwhelmingly voted for me to report on meat\\'s contribution to climate change as part of CNN\\'s Two° series. You commissioned this highly personal topic over more widely feared climate change bad guys such as coal, deforestation and car pollution.Cattle and climate? They\\'re not often used in the same sentence. But eating beef, as I\\'ll explain, has come to be seen, rightly, in certain enviro circles, as the new SUV -- a hopelessly selfish, American indulgence; a middle finger to the planet. It\\'s not the main driver of global warming -- that\\'s burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation -- but it does contribute significantly. Globally, 14.5% of all greenhouse gas pollution can be attributed to livestock, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the most reputable authority on this topic. And a huge hunk of the livestock industry\\'s role -- 65% -- comes from raising beef and dairy cattle. Take a look at how beef compares with other foods. The world is faced with the herculean task of trying to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, measured as an increase of global temperature since the start of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning fossil fuels. That\\'s the point at which climate change is expected to get especially dangerous, leading to megadroughts, mass extinctions and a sea-level rise that could wipe low-lying countries off the map. That one little number -- 2 degrees -- is the subject of international negotiations in December in Paris, which are critical if we\\'re to avert catastrophe.We\\'ve already warmed the atmosphere 0.8 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution; and the World Bank says we\\'re locked in to at least 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming based on the pollution we\\'ve already put into the atmosphere. It will be hard to meet the 2-degree goal no matter what; it will be impossible if livestock pollution isn\\'t part of the mix, said Doug Boucher, a PhD ecologist and evolutionary biologist who is director of climate research and analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We can\\'t hit that goal without it,\" he told me. In Texas, as in most places, however, no one seems too worried.\"Everybody here in Central Texas goes for beef,\" Tomanetz told me. \"People are gonna eat what they wanna eat -- what their appetites call for.\"Any vegetarians around? None she\\'s knows, personally.\"They won\\'t eat their beef,\" she said with a grin, \"so somebody else will.\"70-mile mealIt wasn\\'t long before I wished somebody else had.The night after I ate at Snow\\'s, it felt like a grapefruit was trying to climb out of my esophagus. I ate 0.61 pounds of the beef I was served, leaving 0.66 pounds of the stuff on my tray. I gave the leftovers to a guy at the hotel desk because I couldn\\'t stand to look at it anymore. I felt so crazy-uncomfortable, so full. The next morning, over a decidedly small, vegetarian breakfast, I calculated the climate change pollution associated with my massive meal. I did so with the help of data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from Anne Mottet, livestock policy officer at the FAO.Result: Nearly 29 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases. O\\'Brien Meats in Taylor, Texas, supplies high-quality beef to Snow\\'s BBQ.From the atmosphere\\'s perspective, that\\'s about the same as burning enough fuel to drive an average American car 70 miles, or 113 kilometers. A 70-mile meal.*That\\'s San Antonio to Austin, Texas.Granted, this is a beyond-ridiculously-oversized portion of meat. And, depending on how you calculate beef\\'s climate footprint (Mottet, from the FAO, provided me with her organization\\'s estimate for beef cattle raised in feedlots in North America), you could arrive at very different results. Regardless of the exact mileage, however, this is illustrative of an indisputable fact: Beef contributes to climate change in a substantial and outsize way. Why is that the case? And where does all of that pollution come from? I went on the road to find out. Where are you city slickers?First stop: I wanted to meet a cow like the one I ate at Snow\\'s. And, as it turned out, I wouldn\\'t need to travel far. Kerry Bexley, who opened Snow\\'s BBQ with Tomanetz in 2003, owns a ranch nearby.  Some of the cattle he raises may end up being smoked and served as brisket at the restaurant. Possibly even mine.If only I could find Bexley and his ranch. I kept getting lost en route.Where are you city slickers? he asked over the phone.We\\'re close!I had no idea where we were.We drove maybe 20 miles (an estimated 0.36 pounds of North American beef, in terms of the climate pollution) out of the way before arriving at the rolling green pasture where Bexley raises about 65 or so \"momma and baby\" cows for slaughter. These cattle chomped on tufts of grass, making hilariously bug-eyed faces while we talked.Bexley is a gray-goateed guy with an endearing \"King-of-the-Hill\" twang in his voice. He doesn\\'t think too much about climate change, but when he does he pictures factories and coal mines -- or highways packed with gas-belching cars. \"I would picture the industries -- the large industries,\" he told me. \"A coal-fired power plant or a chemical plant. I think of larger areas, industrial areas.\"Standing in the field, I found it hard to imagine, too.There\\'s a bizarrely satisfying explanation for that, though. You don\\'t see or hear the cattle burping. \\'Cattle are very polite\\'If you want to talk about beef\\'s contribution to climate change, you really have to talk about cow burps (and, to a lesser extent, farts).Scientists don\\'t love the b-word, though.\"We call it eructation,\" said Andy Cole, retired research leader at the Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas, nearly eight hours by car from Bexley\\'s ranch. (To avoid that, I flew from Austin. I know, not exactly green of me.)\"Cattle are very polite,\" Cole told me. \"They don\\'t burp out loud.\" My bad. Sorry, cows. Regardless of verbiage, the focus for Cole and other scientists in Bushland is clear: They want to know how much climate-change pollution cows produce as part of their digestive process. I like to think of it as a Cow Burp Research Station.Cattle are very polite. They don\\'t burp out loud.Andy ColeTheir work sounds silly, but it\\'s vital for two reasons. One: Cattle digest food differently than we do. They\\'re ruminant animals, meaning they have multichamber stomachs where a whole bunch of bacteria hang out waiting to digest cellulose from the grass they eat. Humans -- like all other nonruminants -- can\\'t digest grass. Cows, goats and sheep can, which is fairly incredible when you think about it. They\\'re taking plant material that is hard to digest, and not particularly nutritious, and making food out of it. One byproduct of this magical digestive process, however, is methane. An average cow in North America, raised in a feedlot, belches out 117 pounds (53 kilograms) of this stuff per year, according to 2006 guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pigs and chickens don\\'t do that. And two: Methane is a superpotent greenhouse gas, with 25 times as much global warming potential as carbon dioxide, which is the main climate villain. Understanding how and what we know about the climate-change emissions from beef is so important, because there\\'s rampant misinformation on this topic. On one hand, you have activists who say, incorrectly, that eating meat, especially beef, is the main driver of climate change. It isn\\'t. Fossil fuels are. (If you want to get into the weeds on that subject, take a look at this report in the journal Animal Feed Science and Technology. Oh, you don\\'t subscribe?) Then, you have other environmentalists who claim beef shouldn\\'t be a big part of the climate conversation -- since it will be impossible for the world to meet its climate targets if we don\\'t get off fossil fuels pronto.Without jumping into the fray, researchers out here in the Texas Panhandle are collecting data that helps clear things up. They use all sorts of curious, sci-fi methods to try to understand exactly how much methane is produced. They put cattle inside metal chambers, for example, to measure their burps; they have specialized feeding systems that track how much methane comes out of their nostrils while they\\'re eating a treat; and Richard Todd, a research soil scientist with the USDA\\'s Agricultural Research Service, is experimenting with lasers as a way to track methane emissions coming off the pastures where cattle are raised. Todd has arranged these lasers -- \"not the kind that will burn through steel or anything\" -- in a crosshatch pattern over a field in the Texas Panhandle. The near-infrared lasers are set to a frequency that detects methane. Like all ruminant animals, cattle burp methane as they digest grass. Others, I\\'m told, are doing similar work from airplanes and cell phone towers. This invisible pollution adds up. According to the FAO, which bases some of its stats on work like this, 43% of global greenhouse gas emissions associated with beef cattle come from this \"enteric fermentation\" -- or methane burping.Thinking back to my meal at Snow\\'s, about 12.5 of the 29 kilograms of CO2-equivalent gases came from burping cows. Of the estimated 70 miles you could drive on that much climate-change pollution, about 30 of them come from cow burps. It\\'s the biggest part of beef\\'s climate footprint.\\'Beef Capital of the World\\'Snow\\'s BBQ buys all of its meat from a wholesaler called O\\'Brien Meats in Taylor, Texas. Outside, there\\'s a life-size statue of a cow stuck to the front, like a mermaid on a pirate ship. Inside, I met lab-coat wearing butchers who trim slabs of brisket for Bexley\\'s exacting specifications. You might think that transporting and refrigerating beef would be a big part of its contribution to climate change. But for all the talk of \"food miles,\" processing, refrigeration and transit-related emissions from beef production only account for 8% of its footprint, according to the FAO.To use the miles analogy again, that\\'s only 5.6 of 70 miles.Andy O\\'Brien, who runs the place, told me most of the meat he sells to Bexley likely comes from a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle, possibly in Hereford, Texas, the self-described \"Beef Capital of the World,\" about 475 miles northwest of the meat shop in Taylor. So that\\'s where I went next. Warren White, the cowboy-hat-and-jeans-wearing manager of Mc6 Cattle Feeders, a feedlot in Hereford, agreed to give me a tour. The first thing you notice about being anywhere near Hereford is the smell: the sweet-earthy stench of cow manure, strong enough to stick to your shoes.The smell, though, offers only a hint of how many cattle really are hanging out in this board-flat part of the country. At the Mc6 feedlot alone, the capacity is 55,000 head of cattle. Jayce Winters, spokeswoman for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, told me 3 million cattle live within a 150-mile (241-kilometer) radius of nearby Amarillo at any given time.More ruminant animals means more methane burps, of course. And more poop. About 5% of the emissions associated with beef, the FAO says, come from \"manure storage and management.\" Walking around a feedlot can ping the this-seems-wrong center of your brain. The cattle are organized in numbered pens that seem to stretch to the horizon. Each animal has a number clipped to its ear, making the cattle look like some sort of now-defunct motorcycle gang. They poop and pee all over the place, sometimes while looking you right in the eye. Feedlots, which are where more than nine in 10 cattle in the United States spend part of their lives, are bemoaned by many environmentalists and animal rights activists for being allegedly cruel and for their contributions to water and air pollution. But, when it comes to the climate, feedlot ethics are anything but simple.That\\'s because, according to some studies, feedlots actually are the most efficient way to raise beef cattle. This is logical when you think about it, and all comes back to what they\\'re eating and how long it takes the cattle to grow to \"slaughter weight.\"In a feedlot, cattle eat corn, not grass. So they don\\'t produce as much methane. Plus, they\\'re fattened up quickly, then killed. So, cynically, that means there\\'s less time for them to pollute. That\\'s partly why the U.S. National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association claims this country produces the \"world\\'s most sustainable beef.\"But to fully understand feedlots, you also need to understand the feed.\\'Just like Corn Flakes\\'White, the manager of Mc6 Cattle Feeders, walked me to the one part of his feedlot that smells, surprisingly, less like cow s--- and more like cereal.Tons of corn roared out of a grain elevator, landing in a massive heap. White picked up some of the stuff and sifted it around in his hand. It was still warm from on-site processing. \"If you add sugar and milk, it\\'d be just like Corn Flakes,\" he said.At capacity, the cattle here consume 1.5 million pounds of the stuff per day.Where does it come from?Somewhere in the Midwest, he told me.The \"somewhere\" I visited on the final stop on this beef-climate odyssey was Auburn, Illinois. That\\'s where I found Garry Niemeyer, a corn and soybean farmer, and former president of the National Corn Growers Association, who told me he sells most of his corn to feedlots such as White\\'s in Hereford, Texas. (Some of it, he said, is used to produce ethanol and then byproduct of that becomes food for cattle.)I met him on the first day of harvest: September 8.Niemeyer and I rode in an air-conditioned tractor while enormous red \"combine\" machines started the several-day process of mowing through his rows of corn. These machines are incredible up close: They not only snap the corn stalks, they remove the ears of corn -- each stalk has only one -- and almost-instantly strip the school-bus-yellow kernels of corn off the dimpled cobs, and toss the cobs aside.It\\'s not the harvest that creates the most climate pollution here, however.It\\'s the fertilizer. The fertilizer farmers apply to corn -- which feeds many cattle -- also contributes to climate change. Niemeyer told me he \"applies\" 0.79 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer per bushel of corn. Some of that is \"knifed\" into the ground with giant farm equipment, and other times it\\'s sprinkled on the surface of the land. Some of it is liquid, some of it is solid pellets. Fertilizer is expensive stuff, and Niemeyer uses less than he used to -- down from 1.2 pounds per bushel in the 1990s, he told me, proudly noting that this reduces pollution in a nearby lake and the Gulf of Mexico, which suffers an oxygen-dead zone in the summer because of excessive fertilizer runoff.But it\\'s still a huge amount. And one unwanted offshoot of all this fertilizer use -- and something people out here aren\\'t thinking much about -- is nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is kind of the ultimate greenhouse gas. About 300 times as powerful as CO2.Largely because of fertilizer, producing food such as corn for beef cattle accounts for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions from beef and dairy, according to the FAO. When it comes to beef, it\\'s second only to burps.Cutting down forests means you\\'re cutting down trees, and half of the tree is carbon. When you burn it or let it rot, that produces carbon dioxide.Doug BoucherAnd growing food for our food takes a wider environmental toll. About 70% of this planet\\'s agricultural land is used for livestock production, according to a 2006 report from the FAO. And in total, 30% of all terrestrial land on Earth -- all of it! -- is used for livestock.These are truly astounding figures. True, some of that land is well suited for cattle grazing. \"Eighty-five percent of the land we produce cattle on in the United States isn\\'t suitable for other food production,\" said Daren Williams, spokesman for the U.S. National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association. \"You can\\'t turn the Flint Hills of Kansas into spinach fields.\"\"The argument that we should stop raising ruminant animals on land that is made for ruminant animals is frankly nonsense,\" he added. \"We\\'d be taking vast amounts of land out of food production at a time when we need more not less\" because of population growth.These land-use choices do matter, though.Internationally, for example, rainforests very often are cleared to make room for beef cattle. In the Amazon, cattle production accounts for an estimated 50% to 80% of all deforestation, according to Boucher from the Union of Concerned Scientists.Deforestation is one of the reasons beef from Latin America and the Caribbean is among the worst, per pound, in terms of its effect on climate change. (Europe, North America, Russia and Australia are among the more-efficient beef producers, according to the FAO.)\"Cutting down forests means you\\'re cutting down trees, and half of the tree is carbon,\" said Boucher. \"When you burn it or let it rot, that produces carbon dioxide.\"Carbon dioxide, of course, is a heat-trapping gas. These so-called \"land use changes\" make up 15% of beef\\'s overall contribution to climate change.\\'Meth corn\\'In Illinois, I watched cornfields zip by the window as Sean Bolton (spelled \"like Michael Bolton,\" he told me) drove a truck full of Niemeyer\\'s just-harvested corn down the highway to a towering grain elevator for storage. We could see a blue-gray rainstorm mounting on the horizon as we approached the drop-off.Bolton is 43 and has spent his life doing odd jobs here and there, driving trucks, installing office cubicles -- you name it. Lived all over: Texas, Phoenix, New Jersey, Idaho, Germany, Nebraska. He doesn\\'t look past flaws in the corn industry. \"It\\'s like meth corn, I guess you could say,\" he told me. Meaning: This corn is grown with so much anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that\\'s also an ingredient in methamphetamine (\"You ever seen \\'Breaking Bad?\\'\" he asked), that you could compare it to an illicit drug. He sees this as somehow unnatural, which is a claim Niemeyer and others dispute, noting that technology and fertilizer have helped make corn much more resource-efficient.But what about climate change? Is Bolton concerned about that? \"I think climate change is a government scare tactic,\" he said.Here\\'s the thing, though: Whether he accepts climate science or not (the climate is changing, and we are to blame, as 97% of climate scientists agree), and whether he cares about beef\\'s contribution to climate change or not, Bolton is eating less beef. \"Me and the wife eat a lot of chicken and pork these last few years,\" he told me.Why? \"Because the price of steak has just skyrocketed.\"\"We splurge every now and then,\" he said, \"but I\\'m not a billionaire, by any means.\"Bolton isn\\'t alone.  While the United States is one of the top meat-consuming countries, per capita, our rate of beef consumption actually has been leveling off for a decade or so. Take a look at the trend line.Chalk that up both to increasing prices and greater awareness. Beef now is seen as carrying a host of health, and, increasingly, environmental costs. But consumption is going up internationally, and the trend in the United States is not yet pronounced enough to breathe a sigh of relief. The FAO expects meat consumption to increase 73% by 2050, which could be disastrous for the climate. It\\'s true there are some parts of the world where iron levels are low and where more meat consumption actually would be healthy and would combat malnutrition. But for the industrialized world, meat consumption already is seen by many as unhealthily high. There may be ways to use technology to make beef production more climate-efficient. Scientists are working on new types of cattle feed that will make cows less gassy and therefore less harmful to the climactic system. Researchers in Argentina have experimented with putting backpacks on cattle, using them as tanks to trap the methane they\\'re burping. And, in the long term, other scientists, like those at Modern Meadow, are trying to engineer meat from cell \"cultures,\" in hopes of minimizing ethical and environmental concerns about beef production.The mainstream industry also says it\\'s making changes.\"Are we perfect? Absolutely not,\" said Kim Stackhouse-Lawson, a PhD animal biologist who is executive director of global sustainability at the U.S. National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association, an industry group. \"But I think that this is an industry that gets very excited about continuous improvement. And sustainability is something that they hold very near and dear. It\\'s very personal. They are the original stewards of the land.\"The beef industry in the United States reduced its climate emissions by 2% between 2005 and 2011, she told me, with much of that improvement coming from better packaging, with less plastic, better corn yields and faster-growing animals. Cutting back on food waste, Stackhouse-Lawson said, also would further reduce emissions from the livestock industry.The FAO, for its part, estimates that using local \"best practices\" for livestock production could reduce the sector\\'s greenhouse gas emissions by 30% globally.That\\'s not insignificant. But it\\'s likely not as effective -- or immediate -- as cutting back on beef. \\'Climate carnivore\\'Climate change is a numbers game. If we want to meet the goal of stopping warming short of 2 degrees -- which is of the utmost importance -- we have to cut back on pollution of all types. Fossil fuels must be the central part of these efforts. But beef, too, can be seen as essential. A 2014 study published in the journal Climatic Change makes this clear. If current meat-consumption trends continue, agricultural pollution will amount to 12 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent gases per year by 2050, the study\\'s authors find. That amount of pollution alone could help put us on a path to whiz right by the 2-degree target, they write. With new (but expensive) technology, we might get to 8.3 billion tonnes. Better, but still not safe. Dietary changes would get us much further. If the world adopted a \"climate carnivore\" diet, in addition to the technology, for example, then agricultural emissions would drop to 4.9 billion tonnes in 2050. The authors define a \"climate carnivore\" as someone who replaces three-quarters of beef, ruminant and dairy meals with chicken or other nonmethane burping animals.I think of this as the Chick-fil-A approach. More chicken, less beef. Going for a \"flexitarian\" diet -- replacing three-quarters of beef or lamb meals with vegetables and other sources of protein that aren\\'t meat and dairy -- goes further still, generating only 3.1 billion tonnes of agricultural pollution per year. Either way, \"if you want to be certain to reach the 2-degree target, we have to reduce beef consumption,\" said Fredrik Hedenus, associate professor of energy and environment at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and the lead author of the report on beef\\'s contribution to climate change.Other studies have shown fully vegetarian and vegan diets are, in fact, the most climate-friendly. Think about it: Vegetables are lower on the food chain, and therefore require fewer resources to produce. We don\\'t have to raise food for our vegetables to eat; we do raise corn for cows. Those of you who go vegan or veggie should know that the climate thanks you. But moderate dietary changes would help us hit the 2-degree target, too.It wouldn\\'t be so hard to become a \"climate carnivore.\"If I\\'d ordered 1.27 pounds of whole chicken at Snow\\'s BBQ, instead of beef, for example, I would have created climate pollution equivalent to driving 6.5 miles, not 70, according to a calculation using data provided by Anne Mottet, a livestock researcher at the FAO. If you want to be certain to reach the 2-degree target, we have to reduce beef consumption.Fredrik HedenusI understand these choices likely would have real, and unwelcome, effects on the beef industry. I\\'m torn about that, honestly, since I respect the people who helped produce the brisket I ate in Texas. I don\\'t blame them directly for the emissions associated with their trade. But I\\'ve also stood on the shores of the Marshall Islands, which scientists say may no longer exist if seas rise as much as would be reasonably expected at 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Climate change, as Pope Francis and others have argued, will hurt the poor and vulnerable most. We all should do our part to help cut emissions. It\\'s a moral imperative. And while I can\\'t ensure, on my own, that my electricity comes from 100% renewable sources, I can decide what to eat.  Our diets are a rare chance for us to take control of our climate footprints, as researchers explained to me. We don\\'t need governments or utilities to help.Apathy is all that stands in the way.Two° challenge: Submit a \\'climate carnivore\\' recipeI\\'d like to think people would try to reduce their climate footprints out of the goodness of their hearts, but incentives could provide a needed push. Perhaps boosting the price of beef should be considered. That worked on Sean Bolton, the truck driver in corn country. The European Union puts a price on carbon pollution from cars, for example, but doesn\\'t apply those levies to beef and lamb, the carbon-heavy foods. Labeling should be up for discussion, too. I\\'d want to know, for example, how many pounds of CO2 are associated with steak versus fish. And if I saw that info in the grocery store, it might alter my choices. Whatever gets us there, those of us in the industrialized world -- where meat consumption levels already are too high for our health, for the environment and for the climate -- need to start thinking of meat, and particularly beef, as a rare treat. Not an every-day or every-meal sort of thing. \\'Tender love and care\\'Strangely enough, this is something I could have learned back at the start of my journey, at Snow\\'s BBQ in Lexington, Texas. It\\'s likely unintentional, but a \"climate carnivore\" sensibility is baked into the way the place does business. That\\'s because Snow\\'s BBQ is only open one day per week. Saturday. And for one meal. Which is basically breakfast. Aside from special events, Snow\\'s BBQ is open only on Saturday morning.Tomanetz, the 80-year-old pitmaster, beamed when she told me her restaurant was named the best BBQ place in Texas in 2008. \"It takes a lot of tender love and care to prepare a brisket that\\'s so well liked by so many people,\" she said.So, to recap, this is meat that available only once per week. You have to drive to the middle of nowhere to get it. And it\\'s some of the best in the world. In other words: the definition of a treat. Afterward, if you\\'re me, you\\'re so freaking full you never want to eat beef again. I have to think that if more of us went on the Snow\\'s diet -- the once-a-week, beef-as-treat diet -- we\\'d actually be OK. We need to wean ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels, too, of course. Reducing beef consumption, alone, won\\'t fix climate change. But it would help ensure we hit the 2-degree target.  If you do go to Snow\\'s, give Tomanetz a hug for me. And, a word of advice: Order a smaller plate. More than a pound of anything is way too much. That\\'s especially true for beef.Submit a \"climate carnivore\" recipeSign up for the Two° newsletterFollow John Sutter on Twitter*Math behind the 70-mile meal: Here\\'s how I calculated 1.27 pounds of beef produces the same amount of carbon-dioxide-equivalent pollution as burning enough gasoline to drive 70 miles. According to the FAO\\'s Anne Mottet, eating North American beef, raised in a feedlot, produces about 50 kilograms of CO2e per kilogram of edible beef (it\\'s 35.2 kg CO2e per kg of carcass weight). I converted my 1.27 pound meal into kilograms: 0.576. And then multiplied that by 50 to find that my meal produced about 28.8 kg of CO2e emissions. The U.S. EPA says 0.411 kg of CO2e are emitted per mile driven in a standard American car. (To get that figure, the EPA assumes the car has a fuel efficiency of 21.6 miles per gallon.) So, if you divide 28.8 by 0.411, you get my answer: about 70 miles. Note that this figure does not account for all carbon emissions associated with the lifecycle of a car, only the emissions associated with burning fuel to drive 70 miles. By using different estimates for how much CO2e is associated with a kilogram of beef, and including or excluding different aspects of production, you could arrive at very different mileages. Kim Stackhouse-Lawson, the PhD animal biologist at the National Cattlemen\\'s Beef Association, for example, told me the FAO numbers sound \"high,\" but not unreasonable. The crucial point is emissions associated with beef production are far higher, per unit, than those associated with chicken, pork or vegetables.',\n",

The plan was to be far away from this war,\" said Wais.\"I wanted to be in the center of Europe and to continue to Belgium, because Belgium was for me the home of cycling.\"But the way there, the travel was very long and I was very tired and I stopped in Switzerland and I think I fell in love with the mountain and all these lakes.\"Unlike Mahmoud, Wais says he stayed in Syria for an additional year after his family had already made the decision to flee.He stayed behind in order to compete for Syria in cycling but decided to leave in 2014.\"It was hard for me because they say I must do training every day, but in my head it was very difficult to see what happened around and we lose a lot of people, a lot of friends and family. And finally, with the sport, I say, \\'No, I cannot continue.\\'\"Despite finding a new home, Wais says the journey took so much out of him that he was not able to compete again for over two years until 2017 when he set his sights on the Olympic Games.After receiving a scholarship from the International Olympic Committee in 2019 as a part of its refugee athlete program, the 30-year-old Wais is now focused on performing well at the games and showing the world what refugee athletes can do.\"I hope to be in the top 20 in the time trial for sure; this is my goal or to be the best rider from Asia.\"It means, for me, a lot. It means a lot of work, what I do before [the Games] to be a part of this team and to present this team in the best image in the world.\"And for sure, I will give all my best to be with this team and to be a very good picture for all these people who have left something behind.\"Years after making the difficult choice to leave his home, Aram Mahmoud is now one of 29 refugee athletes that will compete at the 2020 Olympic Games under the Olympic flag.\\'Keep fighting for my dream\\'Although focused on competing in Tokyo, Mahmoud\\'s main goal is to be reunited with his family.He describes an upbringing where his family was often together -- even in sport. Mahmoud\\'s father coached him and his siblings, while he also trained with his sister.\"When they heard I got a scholarship from the Olympic Solidarity Project, they were very happy because I have, like finally got my chance to prove something, to continue what I wanted actually from when I was young.\"So for them, it was very important that I keep fighting actually for my dream and now to be a part of the team and to be able to participate in the Olympics.\"Since leaving Syria, Mahmoud traveled and settled in the Netherlands before ending up in Denmark in January 2021 to pursue his training at the Badminton Centre of Excellence.Like Wais, Mahmoud says that representing the refugee team in Tokyo will mean everything.\"It means a lot for me, because now we can prove to the world actually that we are able to do something and we have a goal.\"We are fighting for our goals, to reach our goals and to let the world see that we can do a lot.\"The refugee Olympic team was first formed for the Rio 2016 Games and is as an opportunity to show the world that refugees are more than just their migrant status.Compatriot and fellow refugee, Yusra Mardini, was one of the 10 athletes selected to represent the inaugural Olympic refugee team in Rio.Mardini and her sister were encouraged to swim from a young age and set their sights on the Olympics after watching Michael Phelps compete on television.After fleeing Syria, the sisters found a new home in Germany where Mardini continued to swim and follow her dreams. However, when she walked out with the Refugee team in 2016, she felt diminished by her newfound status: \"reduced to a single word.\"Now, as an ambassador to the UNHCR and returning to the 2020 Games under the Olympic flag, she says she wants to inspire and educate people around the world about refugees.\"Last Olympics, I represented more than Syria,\" Mardini told CNN Sport.\"I represented millions around the world. And I really love this idea. If I\\'m going to compete under the German flag, or the Syrian flag or the Olympic Flag, I\\'ll be representing all of them.\"Sport actually gave me this really strong voice. I am using it to help refugees to get them to better places, to get them shelter and to just let the people understand that they should open borders for them.\"Ahmad Badreddin Wais competing at the 92nd UCI Road World Championships in 2019. The power of sport While their journeys to the Olympics have been different, both Wais and Mahmoud share one striking experience.They have managed to find new homes and connect with their communities through their sports.\"Cycling, let\\'s say sport, helped me a lot, too, to forget what\\'s happened before [the war] and to be therapy for me.\"It was the best option to meet new people, to have contact, to get to know this culture in Switzerland and in Europe, and it was very helpful for me,\" explained Wais. Mahmoud had a similar experience through badminton when he arrived in Europe.\"It was difficult when I move from Syria to a different country, a different culture; everything is different there.\"The badminton helped me actually to become part of the community there; because I played well, I immediately I made some friends.\"That was the most beautiful thing to have. As a sport or as something else to be able to integrate and learn some more.\"You know more about their culture during the sparring and during the training.\"',\n",

The seven-time World Champion overtook long-time race leader Lando Norris late on. Norris -- who was aiming for a maiden Grand Prix victory and was leading for most of the race -- spun his McLaren in heavy rain.Hamilton eventually finished over 53 seconds ahead of second-placed Max Verstappen, who had started at the back of the grid after Red Bull took a new engine. As well as winning his 100th Grand Prix and becoming the first driver to achieve the feat, he moved back to the top of the driver\\'s championship standings ahead of Verstappen.

Norris, 21, claimed the first pole position of his career on Saturday, battling tough conditions to lead the pack. And after briefly losing the lead of the race to Carlos Sainz, he impressively reclaimed it in the 13th lap. While conditions were dry when the race started, a downpour in Sochi made conditions tough for drivers. Norris and Hamilton initially stayed out, until with four laps to go, the Mercedes driver was advised by his team to switch to intermediate tires. On slick tires with the rain falling more heavily, Norris was caught comfortably by Hamilton as the 36-year-old took the lead late on. The McLaren driver lost speed as he tried to navigate the conditions, before losing control and spinning his car on the 51st lap. He eventually finished seventh, and was clearly emotional afterward.

On Wednesday night, Messi scored twice and hit the woodwork twice in Barcelona\\'s 3-2 victory over Athletic Bilbao, moving the Catalans to third in La Liga. Barcelona was forced to come from behind though, after Inaki Williams raced clear to give Bilbao the lead in just the third minute. Ronald Koeman\\'s men returned to parity in style, with a free-flowing team move ending with Messi\\'s deep cross being headed back by Frenkie de Jong for 18-year-old Pedri to equalize. Read MoreFrom then on, Messi stole the show, sweeping home after a cheeky backheel from Pedri to give Barcelona the lead and then adding a third with an emphatic finish after Antoine Griezmann\\'s incisive pass split the Bilbao defense. Messi celebrates after he scores his team\\'s second goal.His two goals put him tied with three others at the top of the goalscoring charts in Spain on nine overall. It was Messi\\'s errant pass late on that gave Bilbao the chance to halve the deficit, but Barcelona was able to hold on to the three points to move seven behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who has two games in hand on the Catalans. While it hasn\\'t been vintage Barcelona in recent weeks, the early season mistakes look to have been ironed out somewhat. In fact, since losing 3-0 at home to Juventus in the Champions League early in December, Barcelona has gone seven La Liga matches unbeaten, with five wins and two draws.After the game, Pedri praised the team\\'s new-found mental toughness. \"When you concede so early it\\'s normal to drop your heads but we showed a lot of self-belief to make sure that didn\\'t happen,\" the Spain under-21 international said.\"We knew it was an important game, that\\'s how we approached it.

It follows nearly a doubling of Covid-19 cases among players earlier this week.In addition, the National Basketball Association and its players\\' association have agreed to updated protocols for the holiday season, according to a memo obtained by ESPN\\'s Adrian Wojnarowski.It will require increased testing from December 26 to January 8, and masks will be required for players, coaches and staff on the bench, as well as in the locker room, weight room and training room and while traveling with the teams, according to the memo.Wojnarowski, citing the memo, also reported that if a player received a booster shot more than two weeks ago, \"he will not be subject to holiday or gameday testing.\"Read MoreCNN has reached out to the NBA and the players association for comment.The rise in cases has already caused headaches for teams across professional sports. While the NFL has not postponed or canceled any games, several teams lost key players placed on the reserve/Covid-19 list. The NBA has so far postponed two games while the pandemic has led the National Hockey League to postpone 10 games so far.On Thursday an NHL game in Montreal was played with no fans in attendance.Montreal Canadiens statement regarding the measures announced by the Public Health pic.twitter.com/XdGlNhhtcq— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) December 17, 2021\\n\\nThe Canadiens organization said Quebec officials made the request based on \"the spiraling rise of COVID-19 cases in the region.\"The team said games in January will be played with the arena at 50% capacity.Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations in the United States are rising once again, with a seven-day average of 118,717 new cases each day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That\\'s 40% higher than a month ago.Disquiet among playersAn NFL source told CNN that 28 NFL players tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday and there were 37 positive tests among players on Monday.The two-day total is more than double the 29 positive tests from players between November 14 -- 27, the last publicly released testing data from the NFL.CNN has reached out to the league for an updated number of positive cases. Under the new NFL protocol, teams will have to reimpose restrictions such as mandatory mask-wearing while indoors in team facilities, social distancing, grab-and-go meal service in team cafeterias, limits on the number of people allowed in weight rooms, restrictions on activities outside the facility including dining out to eat on the road and all-virtual meetings.Omicron is coming but boosters should fight it, federal health officials sayAnd at least one player isn\\'t at all pleased.

As of Wednesday,  there were 14 players but it was unclear whether all the test results were known then. In addition, the Washington Football team has 21 players on the list and the Los Angeles Rams have 25. An NFL roster comprises 53 players.The NFL describes the reserve/Covid-19 list as being for players who either test positive for Covid-19 or who have been quarantined after having been in close contact with an infected person or persons. Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns was put on the NFL\\'s Covid-19 protocol list this week.NFL medical chief says two-thirds of players with positive tests were asymptomaticThe NFL has no plans as of now to postpone the Browns-Raiders game, Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters at an NFL meeting in Irving, Texas.Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski tests positive for Covid-19\"We feel confident with continuing changes and adaptions to our protocols that we can do that,\" Goodell said Wednesday.The league and the players\\' union also made changes to allow fully vaccinated asymptomatic players to \"test-out\" of quarantine and return to practice and games quicker. The NFL provided three testing options for a fully vaccinated individual to return provided they are asymptomatic for at least 24 hours. An individual\\'s return from quarantine is possible as soon as the day after his or her initial positive test, according to the updated protocols. Before the update, fully vaccinated individuals needed to return two negative tests 24 hours apart to be activated off the reserve/Covid-19 list.Fully vaccinated individuals will continue to test weekly and unvaccinated individuals daily.NFL officials said in a statement that its protocols have evolved and the new ones reflect the rising cases in the league and the emergence of the new Omicron variant.Some of the NFL players who tested positive for the coronavirus had the variant,  NFL Chief Medical Officer Dr. Allen Sills said Wednesday.

In Portugal -- the envy of the continent, where 87% of the total population is inoculated -- the government is mulling new measures as infections inch upwards.Britain has meanwhile endured a lengthy and stubborn wave of infections despite its Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, often trumpeting the country\\'s early lead in administering jabs. And in the Netherlands new restrictions have come into force, prompting protests that turned violent in Rotterdam on Friday night.Read MoreThis is all taking place despite one central fact remaining true -- the vaccines are working, and working well.Some might wonder how both things can be true. But as nations are discovering, even a relatively strong vaccination rate is not enough alone to stop the spread of Covid-19 -- and warning signs from Germany and Austria, where infections have skyrocketed in recent weeks -- show the dangers of complacency. Austria will enter a total national lockdown on Monday, just days after it imposed a lockdown on unvaccinated people. The vaccine \"continues to provide very good protection -- the immunity against severe disease and death is very well maintained,\" Charles Bangham, a professor of immunology and the co-director of Imperial College London\\'s Institute of Infection, told CNN.\"But we know that the Delta variant is very much more infectious,\" he said. \"At the same time, there have been changes in society and behavior ... and in many countries, some of the precautions are being less stringently observed.\"To put it simply, when it comes to stopping transmission, even a very good vaccination rate isn\\'t always good enough.\"Vaccinations help,\" said Ralf Reintjes, professor of epidemiology and public health surveillance at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany. \"They\\'re one stone in the process of stopping the virus. But it\\'s not strong enough alone.\"What counts as \\'highly vaccinated\\'?Ireland is home to one of Europe\\'s highest vaccination rates -- 89.1% of people over the age of 12, and three-quarters of all people, having been immunized -- but it recently imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs as it battles a growing surge in cases and hospitalizations. And that shouldn\\'t be surprising, experts say -- because even small pockets of unvaccinated people can drive transmission. In Ireland\\'s population of 5 million, around a million are still not protected.\"What we have now is an epidemic of the unvaccinated -- about 10% of our population over 12 is unvaccinated, and we\\'re seeing an epidemic in those people, predictably,\" said Sam McConkey, head of the International Health and Tropical Medicine department at the RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences in Dublin.McConkey noted that most children are unvaccinated, that elderly and vulnerable people with co-morbidities can still suffer breakthrough cases, and asymptomatic, healthy people are catching and passing on the virus. \"The combination of those four or five things has meant that our hospitals are getting quite full,\" he said.In Ireland, experts point to an epidemic among the unvaccinated for putting hospitals under strain.Leaders around Europe have increasingly become frustrated at the unvaccinated pockets of their societies. In a dramatic step on Friday, Austria announced it would make vaccinations mandatory for everyone from February -- a move met with a protest of around 10,000 people in Vienna on Saturday. From Monday in neighboring Czech Republic, home of one of the EU\\'s worst uptake rates, confirmation of a vaccination or recovery will be needed to enter various hospitality venues after the country recorded its highest number of new cases to date on Friday.But exasperation is mounting in better-vaccinated nations, too. On Wednesday, Ireland\\'s deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told CNN that unprotected people are \"causing a lot of the trouble\" -- and that Ireland \"wouldn\\'t be imposing the restrictions we are imposing now\" if everyone was vaccinated.The difference between vaccination rates of 70% and 80% is huge, experts say, because each extra percentile further isolates the virus and eases pressure on hospitals. But McConkey said that given the transmissibility of the current Delta variant, no country can truly consider themselves \"highly vaccinated\" -- he argued that until they inoculate a percentage in the mid-90s of their total population, unvaccinated pockets of society would still drive transmission. And so while vaccines are arguably the most important tool in fighting the virus, they can\\'t be expected to stamp out transmission by themselves.\"The new viral variants are just intrinsically more infectious than the old strains,\" said McConkey, who in addition to his research works as a consultant at Beaumont Hospital Dublin.Vaccines continue to dramatically reduce the likelihood of serious illness and death, he noted -- and they have therefore changed the make-up of those needing treatment in intensive care units. There are far fewer admissions than in previous waves, and \"it\\'s now mostly unvaccinated young people, or very elderly people,\" he said.According to Varadkar, about 50% of people in ICU in Ireland currently are unvaccinated.But any trickle of new admissions can put strain on a country\\'s health service. Of Ireland\\'s 294 staffed intensive care beds, 118 are occupied by Covid-19 patients and just 17 remained available, according to the Irish government\\'s daily update on Thursday. \"A significant chunk of health care staff quit after the first two waves -- there\\'s a sense of fatigue and exhaustion that wasn\\'t there before,\" says McConkey, summarizing the morale of his hospital\\'s team as it battles a new wave of cases.\"We\\'d just like this thing to be over.\"Waning immunity comes to the foreEurope\\'s initial vaccine rollout accelerated quickly in the early months of 2021, but nations are now reckoning with the gradually waning immunity of those doses.Two real-world studies published last month confirmed that the immune protection offered by two doses of Pfizer\\'s Covid-19 vaccine begins to drop off after two months or so, although protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death remains strong. Studies have shown similar outcomes for the AstraZeneca and Moderna shots, which are also in use in Europe.\"The immune reaction of those people who are vaccinated is decreasing over a certain period of time ... and as the vaccination campaign started in Germany at the beginning of this year, we now see some age groups and some people lose their immunity against Covid-19 quickly,\" said Tobias Kurth, a professor of public health and epidemiology and the director of the Institute of Public Health at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin.\"This is probably one of the reasons why the numbers of vaccinated people who need hospitalization is slowly increasing at the moment -- especially in the older population, who got vaccinated first,\" added Reintjes.Daily reported Covid-19 cases\\n\\n\\nExperts stress that the protection against serious illness and deaths remains strong in double-vaccinated people who have not yet received a booster. \"The good news is that both the antibodies and the T-cells [from vaccination] seem to be quite well maintained for months. There\\'s a slight drop in their concentration, but it\\'s very small,\" Bangham said. \"It continues to provide very good protection -- the immunity against severe disease and death is very well maintained,\" he added. \"You\\'re more likely to get symptoms, but you\\'re still quite well protected against severe disease.\"\"The problem is that if you get symptoms, you\\'re probably more likely to pass it on. So the transmission is not so well controlled.\"And over time, that pushes up a country\\'s rate of infections and can impact hospital capacity.\"There certainly has been waning protection from infection, and the ability to transmit it. But thankfully, there\\'s been less waning protection from disease,\" McConkey noted.People wait to be vaccinated at the center in Berlin. Germany has one of western Europe\\'s worst vaccination rates, and it is battling a \"dramatic\" surge in cases.One study from Israel covered 4,800 health care workers and showed antibody levels wane rapidly after two doses of vaccine, \"especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.\" A second study from Qatar showed protection from the Pfizer vaccine peaked in the first month after vaccination and then began to wane.Those findings add urgency to Europe\\'s rollout of booster shots, which is varying in pace around the continent.\"It\\'s certainly a concern. We vaccinated really fast in the beginning, and then it slowed very much down. So now the waning is probably happening faster than the new boosters [are being administered],\" said Reintjes.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN this week that recent data from Israel show that, among people age 60 and older, those who received a booster were less likely to become severely ill than vaccinated people who had not received a booster. Rates of severe disease remained highest among those who weren\\'t vaccinated.A go-slow approachNo matter how impressive a country\\'s vaccination rate appears, experts insist that vaccines alone can\\'t be expected to halt a country\\'s epidemic.\"The vaccine is controlling deaths -- but what we\\'re seeing is a virus that has established itself as endemic, and in some countries it\\'s made greater progress than others because there have been less rigid controls,\" said David Heymann, a former executive director of the World Health Organization\\'s Communicable Diseases Cluster and a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine..Restrictions differ from country to country, and adherence to them can differ wildly too. And that means even well-vaccinated nations like Ireland can suffer serious surges.\"We\\'re very good at socializing in Ireland,\" McConkey said. \"We have to recognise that our socializing is culturally specific, and different between countries ... In Spain and Portugal you eat outside at 10 o\\'clock at night -- in Ireland, we squash into crowded restaurants.\"Daily reported Covid-19 cases\\n\\n\\nSpain and Portugal, with vaccination rates of 80% and 87% of the total population respectively, have seen uptake similar to that of Ireland and have also relaxed rules on social mixing in recent months. But so far, they have avoided the worst of the current wave -- with experts pointing to the apparent success of their mitigation measures.\"Spanish people have been particularly careful regarding restriction measures, mostly the generalized use of face masks and [social] distance,\" said Ana M Garcia, professor of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at the University of Valencia.\"The use of masks is only compulsory indoors, and this is generally accomplished, but also you can find many people still using masks outdoors,\" she said.Despite achieving high rates of vaccination, the Iberian peninsula has moved slowly and cautiously towards normality -- as well as in indoor public spaces, masks are still required on public transport in Spain. In Portugal masks also remain mandatory on public transport, and Prime Minister Antonio Costa warned on Tuesday that restrictions could return amid a new rise in cases.And some experts point to those two countries for a blueprint on how even well-vaccinated nations should approach the virus. \"In my view, the difference in vaccination coverage in different countries is making the big difference in incidence rates,\" Garcia said. \"(But) it\\'s not the only explanation ...  vaccines alone can\\'t fully contain a virus.\"\\'Corona fatigue\\'Nonetheless, the importance of following Covid-19 measures is more keenly felt in countries where vaccination rollouts have stalled. And in Germany, which has one of Western Europe\\'s lowest inoculation rates, some experts blame a shift in public perception.\"One of the major factors is Corona fatigue -- people are really tired of the pandemic,\" said Reintjes.\"We\\'ve just had a general election [where Covid-19] was a bit out of focus; politicians were focusing on other things, and the impression lots of people received was that the problem is not that big anymore,\" he said.Germany on Thursday recorded more than 65,000 new daily Covid-19 infections and outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel called the country\\'s situation \\'\\'dramatic.\\'\\' But even amid skyrocketing cases, many German bars and Christmas markets are attracting large numbers, Reintjes noted. Cologne\\'s carnival season opened last week to big crowds, though only vaccinated or recovered people were admitted.German ministers are urging more people to take up the vaccine, and are making life more difficult for those who choose not to -- its likely incoming coalition government recently strengthened its Covid-19 response plan to require vaccination proof at a wide number of social venues.Daily reported Covid-19 cases\\n\\n\\nBut experts recognize that such attempts are too late to stem this surge. \"Within a short period of time it\\'s not possible to achieve vaccination rates that would stop this wave,\" Reintjes said.Instead, they insist that following measures and reducing socialization can make the immediate difference. \"The autumn-winter season is the best season for transmitting the virus. People are indoors, and that plays an important role,\" Reintjes said. \"People are fed up [with Covid-19] and they don\\'t stick to behavior which would limit the spread of the virus. So it\\'s spreading much better now.\"',\n",

From the age of 12 or 13, he remembers being out on a bike even in the small hours. \"I would leave the house sometimes at two or three in the morning for whatever frustrations I was dealing with and just ride under the moonlight in the local hills and mountains,\" Sanchez tells CNN Sport. That may have been more than 30 years ago, and the bike he rides today may be different to the mountain bike he rode as a kid, but the allure of the sport remains the same.  These days, cycling is also his career. One of the top handcyclists in the world, Sanchez is a six-time medalist across three Paralympic Games and also has multiple world championship titles.It was in the years following a spinal cord injury, sustained during a motorcycle accident in 2001, that Sanchez discovered handcycling; the impact the sport had on his life was immediate. Read More\"When I first started riding, literally just going around the block was a feat in and of itself,\" he says.\"But it made me feel so alive because of the adrenaline and the blood pumping and just the feel-good chemicals of working out. \"It became addictive, but it was all still mostly just the idea of getting out of the house and releasing my frustrations with my broken back and the accident.\" Sanchez is getting ready to compete at his fourth Paralympic Games.\\'The journey, not the destination\\'Having joined the US Marine Corps in 1996, Sanchez was in the process of transferring to the Navy as a Navy SEAL at the time of the accident. \"We\\'re talking about a transition from special operations, kicking doors and hostage rescue type mentalities of military operations to now: you broke your back, you did some permanent damage, you\\'re never going to walk again,\" says Sanchez.\"I mean, the idea of me being competitive at any level at that point wasn\\'t on my mind at all. It was literally just so I can get out of the house and keep me from going insane.\"But over the years, Sanchez gradually transitioned into racing and was introduced to the US Paralympic team ahead of Beijing 2008. \\'I won\\'t die a boring death, but I will make a big smash,\\' says \\'The Butterfly Lady\\' of Paralympic table tennisThere, he won gold in the time trial and bronze in the road race. Two Games and four more medals later, he\\'s now preparing to compete at the Tokyo Paralympics, noting that the way he\\'s viewed his success has changed over the years. \"I felt so utterly broken and worthless because of my interpretation and perception of my being an individual with a disability who can\\'t walk, those medals meant I was still a successful person and therefore I was worthy because of those medals,\" says Sanchez, reflecting on how he felt after his first Paralympics. \"But now, I no longer contend with that depression and those ways of thinking. My body might be broken per se, but I am not broken. And so now, the medals are more of a testament to the person I\\'ve become. \"Instead of being attached or identified by my successes, I\\'m more attached and identified by my capacity to achieve those successes -- the journey, not the destination.\"Tokyo will be the next step of the journey, with the Paralympics getting underway on August 24. Despite mounting pressure in Japan to call off the Games as the country recovers from a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, organizers maintain that the Olympics and Paralympics will go ahead with countermeasures in place to ensure participants are safe. The Japanese city that\\'s rooting for South Sudan at the OlympicsAs for Sanchez, he\\'s ready to embrace the situation in the same way he does with most other challenges. \"The notion of me going to Tokyo or even traveling internationally, I don\\'t really feel threatened by a lot of these things because in my back mind -- and this has a lot to do with obviously my military background and special ops mindset -- I almost want to throw it at me just to prove to myself that I can contend with it,\" he says.\"It\\'s that very Spartan, go-getter, pit bull sort of mindset. But from a social standpoint, the question is what is ethically, morally most prudent and strategic for resolving and getting past this pandemic as fast as possible ... the answer is never clear and it\\'s never easy.\"He adds that he\\'s happy to leave it to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) \"to be the thinkers, and me to do the action.\"LA 2028Currently, Sanchez\\'s schedule involves a ride of between two to three hours, four to five days a week around his home in San Diego County, California. Aside from being on the bike, his routine also involves other more unusual training aspects, such as taking a cold shower each morning. Sanchez is hoping to add to his six Paralympic medals in Tokyo. \"I don\\'t even touch the hot stick whatsoever ... that\\'s the protocol,\" says Sanchez.\"Nobody enjoys taking a cold shower, and so if you learn to manage those thoughts and that experience and that chaos that precedes jumping in that cold shower ... you benefit from thought-management.\"The birth of his son in September also means that Sanchez now has to balance training with the emotional pull of being at home: \"Sometimes, I have to say, \\'Nope, nope, we got to stick to the plan. We can play with the little guy later in the evening,\\'\" he says. It\\'s a conflict of feelings that he will likely have to contend with for a little while longer. As long as he remains healthy and continues to have the right support -- Team USA has been backed by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics -- Sanchez has no immediate plans to stop competing.  \"I would have said that the likeliness that I retire following these Games was a possibility that I was entertaining, especially now that I\\'ve migrated into fatherhood and family and all that,\" he says.\"But certain opportunities have presented themselves to incentivize my possibly competing as far out as the 2028 Games because of the nature of their location in Los Angeles ... where the majority of my family is based.\"',\n",

But he said one key message he\\'ll be telling state premiers is a return to lockdowns, tight social restrictions and fines for violating them is not the answer. \"We have got to get past the heavy hand of government and we\\'ve got to treat Australians as adults,\" Morrison said at a news conference in Queensland Tuesday. \"We have to move from a culture of mandates to a culture of responsibility. That\\'s how we live with the virus into the future.\"Read MoreHis comments come as New South Wales reported 3,057 cases in the 24 hours to 8 p.m. local time Monday -- a record for daily infections in the country. A total of 284 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 in the state, with 39 patients in intensive care. Long queues formed outside testing centers as thousands of people complied with orders to take a test ahead of the holiday.A worker speaks to people inside their cars at the St. Vincent\\'s Bondi Covid-19 testing center on December 21, in Sydney, Australia. Meanwhile, Queensland state health authorities warned Tuesday they are seeing a doubling in cases every two days -- a growing number of which are the Omicron variant -- but said they will move forward with easing quarantine restrictions.  The rise in infections in Australia comes as countries across much of the Asia-Pacific region are delaying their reopening plans, with some reimposing restrictions or tightening border controls over Omicron concerns.The World Health Organization said on Monday that Omicron is spreading \"significantly faster\" than the Delta variant and is causing infections in people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19. But scientists still don\\'t know for sure if the variant causes more severe disease or to what extent existing vaccines are less effective against it.A shift to personal responsibilityNSW Premier Dominic Perrottet echoed Prime Minister Morrison\\'s words in an op-ed for Australia\\'s Daily Telegraph on Monday, despite the rising cases in his state.\"One of the most powerful reflexes is the feeling that with every new case, we should lock everything down,\" Perrottet said. \"But this is not December 2019, and since the virus first emerged, one thing above all else has changed the game: vaccination.\"The premier said if the trajectory of an outbreak threatens to overwhelm health services the state will change its approach, but \"it is time to shift the balance back to personal responsibility.\"\"NSW is resilient. Our people are strong. This is our moment to stand tall and lead the nation out of this pandemic,\" Perrottet said. In Australia, 90.6% of people age 16 and over have been double vaccinated, according to the Department of Health. But while vaccination is a key pillar in the country\\'s Covid response, a growing divide appears to have opened between the government and health experts since the emergence of Omicron.Sydney and Melbourne relaxing isolation rules for fully vaccinated international travelersThe president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid said the \"reckless\" approach adopted by Perrottet was putting lives at risk.\"DIY contact tracing, watered-down check in requirements, the abandonment of mask wearing mandates, and the removal of density limits are together a recipe for disaster and by the time hospital admissions and ICU cases grow beyond whatever benchmark he is working to -- it will be too late,\" Khorshid said in a statement.Dan Suan, a researcher and clinical immunologist from Sydney\\'s Garvan Institute of Medical Research, said in a 17-minute Facebook video posted on Sunday that if Sydney residents don\\'t change their behavior in the run up to Christmas, the city could be \"sleepwalking into a catastrophic disaster in January.\"\"Virtually everybody can catch Omicron. We risk turning Christmas day into a simultaneous super spreader event all across Sydney in thousands of households,\" Suan said in the video.\"If everybody catches Omicron on Christmas Day, then there will be a hospital-based disaster by early January because all the infections happen at the same time. And we know what happens when a huge number of people attempt to try to get a hospital bed at the same time. They can\\'t get the care that they need. And the death toll starts to climb far higher than it should,\" he said. Last week, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned that, based on current modeling, the state could record up to 25,000 new infections a day by the end of January. Around AsiaAcross Asia-Pacific, Omicron is forcing countries to rethink loosening their restrictions.In South Korea, serious Covid infections are reaching record highs and the country\\'s President Moon Jae-in has ordered national university hospitals to focus on treating critically ill Covid-19 patients. Asia-Pacific wants to live with Covid. Omicron is threatening those reopening plansMoon told public hospitals in the greater Seoul area to shift specialization to infectious diseases where possible, called for an expansion of hospital beds for treating Covid-19 patients and said military doctors should be assigned to treat seriously ill Covid patients.On Sunday, South Korea reported a record 1,025 critically ill Covid-19 patients. The number slightly dropped to 997 on Monday, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).Last week, the government reversed its phased plan to ease restrictions and instead reinstated stringent social distancing measures, including a 9 p.m. curfew nationwide for restaurant and cafes.On Tuesday, New Zealand said it will push back its phased border reopening until the end of February over Omicron concerns. The measures were expected to begin as early as January.And last week, Malaysia announced new Covid-19 measures, including banning mass gatherings and requiring booster doses for high-risk groups as it reported its second case of the Omicron variant, according to Reuters.

Brettler referenced a settlement that Andrew\\'s lawyers said Giuffre had previously entered, precluding her from pursuing litigation against anyone connected to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \"We believe, however, that this is a baseless, non-viable and potentially unlawful lawsuit that plaintiff has filed against the Duke. There has been a settlement agreement that the plaintiff has entered into in a prior action that releases the Duke and others from any and all potential liability,\" Brettler said.

Kaplan ordered a schedule for the parties to file procedural motions that will play out before he makes a decision on the service of the lawsuit and whether that settlement agreement should be shared with the Prince\\'s counsel. An in-person hearing in New York is scheduled for October 13. CNN reached out to attorneys for both parties for comment.Giuffre says she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including Prince Andrew, the Queen\\'s second son, when she was a minor. While Andrew has denied the claims, he has been seen in photos with Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and former girlfriend of Epstein who is currently charged with conspiracy and sex trafficking amongst other charges.US authorities have previously accused Andrew of not cooperating with attempts to interview him as part of the investigation into the alleged sex trafficking ring \\u200bEpstein and Maxwell are suspected of operating.The Prince stepped back from royal duties in the wake of a 2019 interview he gave the BBC in which he was widely considered to have damaged his own credibility.

Anderson was then pulled by Brian Snitker as he turned to the bullpen to start the sixth inning.However, the decision was vindicated after a spotless night for the Braves\\' bullpen, with four scoreless innings, two hits and no walks. Closer Will Smith picked up the save with a scoreless 9th.Read More\"You want the chance to compete, especially on the biggest stage like this is,\" Anderson told reporters. \"I knew he wasn\\'t going to budge, it\\'s hard to.

Minter and Luke Jackson carried the no-hitter into the 8th before a bloop base hit off the bat of Aledmys Diaz in front of left fielder Eddie Rosario cost the Braves a chance to become the second team in World Series history to throw a no-hitter.Atlanta scored in the 3rd when Austin Riley lashed an RBI double down the left field line to score Rosario. The rest of the night was a one-run nail-biter, with Travis d\\'Arnaud providing much-needed insurance with a 437-foot monster home run to center field in the bottom of the 8th to make it 2-0.\"I think we didn\\'t swing it for one game,\" said Astros infielder Alex Bregman. \"I think we flush it and move on to the next day and have a short memory. \"You have to in this game.

Compare that to the 2019-2020 season when 92 penalties in total were given.Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has credited former manager Jose Mourinho for making his team more \"savvy\" when it comes to winning penalties suggesting, as many thought, that winning a spot-kick may be more complicated than you might first think.Speaking to the Football Writers\\' Association (FWA) on Thursday, Rashford said a conversation with Mourinho, who managed United between 2016-2018, changed the way he approached his behavior in the box.\"As a forward line, we want to go and score goals, when you are making runs in behind or dribbling with the ball and if you see a challenge coming, you don\\'t want to get tackled because you are looking at an opportunity to score a goal,\" Rashford told the FWA.Read More\"There is no way you are going to let somebody take the ball off you, so for me it is just a case of us wanting to score goals and the teams wanting to defend goals and penalties can happen.\"\"I remember when Jose [Mourinho] was manager, there were five or six times where I should have had a penalty and Jose ended up saying to me: \\'If you are not savvy about the way you do it, then you are not going to be given it.\\'\"After that, we started to get a few penalties. It was something that in terms of development you have to learn that and understand it.\"READ: Jurgen Klopp takes a swipe at Manchester United after a frustrating defeatMarcus Rashford says he has learned to be \"savvy\" to win penalties. \\'I don\\'t think you can blame players\\'Players from every team in the league have long been accused of diving or of going down too easily on occasion.To some, it\\'s a blatant disregard for the credibility of the game whilst others see it as mastering a necessary dark art.Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey says he doesn\\'t blame players who go down after contact in the box, admitting officials don\\'t tend to give fouls when players stay on their feet.\"I don\\'t think you can blame players for going down under contact because they are asking the question of the referee. They\\'re just doing their job,\" Halsey told CNN Sport.\"Perhaps referees have been to blame partly because when there has been a clear penalty and the player hasn\\'t gone down, the referee hasn\\'t given it.\"When you\\'re going at pace into the box and there is slight contact, you will lose balance and you will go down [...] it\\'s not easy for referees.\"Rashford\\'s comments come amid an increasingly heated debate over penalties being awarded in the Premier League, perhaps fueled by a potential title race not many had predicted at the start of the season: United versus fierce rivals Liverpool. The two teams meet on Sunday when first meets second in the table.The spat started after Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp questioned United\\'s penalty record earlier this month, saying it had \"more penalties in two years than I had in five-and-a-half years.\"Solskjaer initially brushed off Klopp\\'s comments, saying he doesn\\'t spend his time counting how many penalties Liverpool gets, but did suggest that such comments might influence decisions in the future.United has been awarded 32 penalties since the start of the 2018/19 season compared to Liverpool\\'s 17. The Old Trafford club also set a new Premier League record after it was awarded 14 penalties last season. After United beat Leicester City in the previous campaign -- courtesy of a Rashford penalty -- Solskjaer reflected on his team\\'s knack of winning spot-kicks: \"I think it\\'s the type of players we\\'ve got. They\\'ve got quick feet, good skills and most of [the penalties] haven\\'t even been debatable.\"Bruno Fernandes converts a penalty for Manchester United this season. \\'Nonsense\\' However, Manchester United (six) has only been awarded one more penalty than Liverpool in the league this season, while both teams have scored the same amount (five).It\\'s true to say a number of these penalties have been controversial, even with VAR\\'s help.Halsey says the introduction of multiple replays has actually made the referee\\'s job harder, by slowing down the incident too much and showing countless different angles.\"If you slow it [footage] down and watch it enough times, you can make an argument for any decision,\" he says.But Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for 14 years, says any suggestion that United is treated more favorably than other teams is \"nonsense.\"He also says the concept of managers getting into the referee\\'s head is overplayed.\"All the managers do it [compain about decisions.] It\\'s just part of the course of managers playing mind games with the opposition and maybe with referees,\" he said.\"When I was doing these games, I never watched the press conferences, you just go and referee what\\'s in front of you.\"You sometimes had managers waiting for you at halftime, having a right go at you and trying to get into your head but you\\'ve got to be mentally tough and that\\'s why you\\'re refereeing at the top level.\"READ: Messi scores twice to help resurgent Barcelona move to third in La LigaLiverpool\\'s boss Jurgen Klopp has been angered by United\\'s penalty record. \\'We want something they have\\'Such discourse has laid the foundations for Sunday\\'s tantalizing fixture as United travel to face Liverpool at Anfield.Solskjaer\\'s side is currently three points ahead of the reigning champion which has struggled for form in recent weeks.Another win over its rivals could see the Old Trafford side stake a real claim for this season\\'s title -- an achievement which might well surprise even the strongest of United\\'s supporters.\"Being where we are in the league just gives us more confidence and it\\'s a sign of where we are at,\" said Solskjaer in his pre-match press conference.\"The game against the champions, who have an amazing record at Anfield, is a great test for us.\"Can we go there and cause an upset?

Paris (CNN)It all started with damning allegations from book excerpts published in France\\'s prestigious Le Monde newspaper as the new year began. \"I was 14 and I let it go (...). I was 14, I knew and didn\\'t say anything.\" \"My stepfather would come into my brother\\'s room. I could hear his footsteps in the hallway and knew he was joining him. In this silence, I imagined things. That he was asking my brother to stroke him maybe, to suck him.  \"I was waiting. I was waiting for him to come out of the room, full of unfamiliar and immediately despised smells,\" the book\\'s author, 45-year old lawyer Camille Kouchner, wrote. \"By not naming what was happening, I participated in the incest.\" More than a month after its publication, Kouchner\\'s book, \"La familia grande,\" continues to rock France. Read MoreIn it, Kouchner accuses her step-father, leading French intellectual Olivier Duhamel, of abusing her twin brother starting when he was 14. The twins are the children of former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. Their step-father, Duhamel, is a Socialist former member of the European Parliament and a renowned political pundit who also headed the governing board of Sciences Po, one of France\\'s leading universities.\"Being subjected to personal attacks, and in an attempt to preserve the institutions in which I work, I terminate my functions,\" Duhamel wrote on Twitter on January 4, shortly after the accusations surfaced. The tweet coincided with his quitting the governing board of Sciences Po as well as leaving roles in an intellectual club and a political science publication.Duhamel has since deleted the tweet and his Twitter account. The book \"La familia grande,\" written by Camille Kouchner, has prompted a national reckoning with child abuse.On January 5, the Paris Prosecutor\\'s office announced it was opening an investigation into Duhamel for \"rape and sexual assault by a person having authority over a 15-year-old minor,\" despite the statute of limitations having run out.CNN has reached out to Duhamel\\'s attorney for comments but has not received a reply. The political scientist has not publicly spoken since his resignation. Duhamel\\'s stepson -- Camille\\'s Kouchner\\'s twin brother -- also filed a complaint against Duhamel last month, according to a statement by his lawyer Jacqueline Laffont obtained by CNN and initially sent to AFP news agency. \"In the context of the \\'Duhamel case\\', the alleged victim informed the AFP, through his lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont, that he had filed a complaint against his ex-stepfather, Mr. Olivier Duhamel following the opening of a preliminary investigation by the Paris prosecutor\\'s office,\" the statement read. Top university shakenThe repercussions of the Duhamel case are being felt far beyond his family circle.Sciences Po director Frederic Mion resigned on Tuesday in a letter to professors and students that was published on the university\\'s website.The university is one of France\\'s most elite schools, having produced five French prime ministers and five French presidents including current leader Emmanuel Macron. For the past month, Mion was under pressure to resign from student groups after acknowledging he was made aware of the allegations against Duhamel as early as 2018. In his resignation letter, Mion referred to an Education Ministry report on his handling of the case, conceding that he committed \"an error of judgment in dealing with the allegations that were communicated to me in 2018 as well as inconsistencies in the way I have expressed myself on this case after it broke.\"French cinema faces moral reckoning as Roman Polanski\\'s new film up for 12 gongs at prestigious awardsIn a statement released on January 7, Mion reacted to an article published in Le Monde newspaper the day before claiming that he knew of the allegations despite initially denying them. \"With neither tangible evidence nor any further or precise knowledge of the situation, I had difficulty believing that the rumors could be founded,\" Mion wrote in the statement. He said that discovering through press reports the extent of Duhamel\\'s alleged actions was \"a shock to me personally.\" But on Wednesday, in an email to CNN, former Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti -- once a colleague of Mion at Sciences Po --  said that Mion had called her when the revelations around Duhamel surfaced a month ago and allegedly told her: \"We shouldn\\'t let anyone think that we knew.\"CNN has reached out to Mion but has not received a reply.  Mion is only one of many members of the French elite to be hit by the Duhamel scandal. Jean Veil, a prominent attorney and old friend of Duhamel, admitted to Le Monde newspaper that he was aware of the incest for \"at least 10 years,\" invoking \"professional secrecy\" to explain his silence. Camille Kouchner denounced what she views as the silence of the French intelligentsia in her book. \"Very quickly, the microcosm of people in power, Saint-Germain-des-Prés [a fancy neighborhood on the Left Bank that has long been associated with the French intellectual elite] was informed. Many people knew, and most pretended nothing had happened,\" she wrote.Victims come forwardBeyond the country\\'s elite where it originated, the Duhamel scandal has prompted a national reckoning on incest in France, with hundreds of purported victims coming forward on social media under the hashtag #MetooInceste. French people took to Twitter to share harrowing stories of childhood abuse at the hands of parents and family members and how that trauma -- and the accompanying sense of shame and isolation -- often persisted well into their adult lives.Feminist thinker and activist Caroline De Haas, who was one of the initiators of  #MeTooIncest, told CNN: \"We wanted to show incest was a political, collective issue.\"She explained the #MeTooIncest movement came from a will to shift from the individual story of the Kouchner twins towards a collective history of incest. Students demonstrate in front of the Sciences Po university to denounce gender-based violence. Signs read \"We believe you\" and \"Silence = accomplice.\"French lawyers have also seen a rise in the number of victims stepping forward to share their stories. Child protection lawyer Marie Grimaud told France Inter radio on Tuesday that \"for three weeks we have received many calls from women who have realized the need to speak, to meet a lawyer, to file a complaint.\" In addition to victims themselves, Grimaud said her office had been contacted by people \"on behalf of a brother or little sister or a niece\" who they believe \"may be in danger.\"Facing Incest, an NGO supporting abuse victims, said 10% of French people had suffered incest, according to a representative survey of 1,033 French adults aged 18 and above, interviewed online November 4-5, 2020, by the IPSOS polling agency. \"It is a mass crime we are talking about,\" says the non-profit. Facing Incest has long advocated for changing the legislation to better protect minors from sexual abuse within the family. With the Duhamel scandal grabbing French media headlines for over a month, the government has taken hold of the issue. Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told France 2 public broadcaster on Tuesday that the government planned to categorize any penetrative sexual relationship with a child under 15 as rape.Currently, for a sexual relationship with a minor under 15 to be treated as a serious crime -- rather than a lesser offense with a lighter penalty -- it is necessary to prove coercion, violence, threat or surprise.French film star Adele Haenel accuses director of abuse \"The issue of consent of the victim won\\'t be raised anymore. We won\\'t question whether or not the victim was consenting,\" if they were under 15, junior Minister for Children and Family Adrien Taquet told Europe 1 on Tuesday.In France, incest is legally defined as sexual intercourse between two people who are related to a degree where marriage is prohibited. Besides direct family ties, the prohibition also includes relatives by marriage -- so divorcees cannot marry a child or parent of their ex-spouse for instance.  The civil code doesn\\'t prohibit marriage between cousins.Beyond that, incest is not illegal as long as the relationship is freely consensual between people above 15, the age of sexual consent in the country. While rape is prohibited no matter who the perpetrator is, sexual offenses committed by a family member or \"any person having authority over the victim\" face a heavier penalty. Facing Incest said on its Twitter account that the government\\'s proposals on the age of consent were \"elusive\" and expressed the hope that MPs would bring more clarity as they work on the bill. De Haas told CNN that the current debates around the bill \"bothered\" her due to their focus on repressive legislation. \"What\\'s needed is a public policy of training and prevention,\" she said. Reflecting on the broader impact of the Duhamel scandal on French society, De Haas said the case had brought incest to the forefront of public debate and made it a high-profile political issue. \"That is thanks to the legacy of #MeToo\" she said, noting that the movement brought a realization that sexual violences were not isolated acts but a social and political phenomenon.

The British Prime Minister is set to welcome US President Joe Biden to Cornwall, England, on Thursday for a bilateral meeting where the pair are scheduled to discuss a new \"Atlantic Charter\" -- a modern update to the joint statement between Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the challenges facing the world after the Second World War. Biden is in the UK because Johnson is hosting the G7 summit in what was supposed to be Britain\\'s big return to the international arena. Instead, Thursday\\'s talks will most likely be overshadowed by heated discussions on the current and very real danger of violence erupting in Northern Ireland, as the real-world consequences of Brexit continue to undermine the peace deal brokered by the US in 1998. The Times of London newspaper reported Wednesday that America\\'s senior diplomat in Britain, on the orders of Biden, berated Johnson\\'s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, for \"inflaming\" tensions on the island of Ireland.Read MoreThe report said that in recent days, US envoy Yael Lempert issued a \"demarche\" --  a diplomatic reprimand that is usually reserved for hostile states rather than allies -- over the UK government\\'s failure to implement a part of the Brexit deal brokered with Brussels last year that is designed to protect peace on the island. \"This is wrong. First, this discussion wasn\\'t directed by the President. It was not heightened. As with any ally, we have diplomatic conversations about areas where we have concern at many levels,\" a senior Biden administration official told CNN. Biden and Johnson expected to commit to lifting US-UK Covid-19 travel restrictionsBut it is well-known that Biden is an opponent of any version of Brexit that undermines the peace in Ireland, and the President plans to press Johnson on the issue during their talks, other senior administration officials said.\"President Biden has been crystal clear about his rock-solid belief in the Good Friday Agreement as the foundation for peaceful coexistence in Northern Ireland. That agreement must be protected, and any steps that imperil or undermine it will not be welcomed by the United States,\" Biden\\'s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Europe.He declined to say whether the US believed Johnson was taking steps to imperil the agreement.\"I\\'m only going to say that President Biden is going to make statements in principle on this front,\" Sullivan said. \"He\\'s not issuing threats or ultimatums; he\\'s going to simply convey his deep-seated belief that we need to stand behind and protect this protocol.\"The British government said it would not comment on the matter until after Thursday\\'s talks. Unusually for a meeting between US and UK leaders, there will be no joint press conference afterward, just a background briefing for journalists and a readout. It\\'s not implausible that this is because it would be impossible for the issue of Northern Ireland to be dodged, creating a difficult diplomatic moment on camera, something both men would rather avoid. The problems Brexit has created for Northern Ireland are very serious. The UK province shares a border with the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member state. The \"Northern Ireland Protocol\", which forms part of the UK-EU Brexit deal, chiefly seeks to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It does so by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU\\'s customs area and single market for goods, meaning there is no need for physical checks for goods crossing the border. The arrangement has created a de facto sea border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, which has enraged unionists in Northern Ireland and in Britain. But Johnson has yet to fully implement the protocol, for fear of food shortages in Northern Ireland among other things. This, the EU correctly points out, is a violation of the treaty Johnson agreed with Brussels and a breach of international law. In March, the EU launched legal action against the UK over London\\'s unilateral attempts to extend the Brexit grace period on food imports to Northern Ireland. Talks between Frost and his EU counterpart on how to resolve the impasse over the protocol failed to produce a solution on Wednesday, and there is no clear sign of one in the immediate term. Boris Johnson will finally tell the world what post-Brexit Britain is forBack in September before he won the presidency, Biden warned that the Good Friday Agreement could not \"become a casualty of Brexit,\" and said that any UK-US trade deal, touted by many as the most significant outcome of leaving the EU, \"must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.\"He doubled down on this stance as President-elect in November, saying the \"idea of having the border north and south once again being closed, it\\'s just not right.\"Johnson, meanwhile, has signaled a willingness to move on from Brexit, telling the Atlantic magazine in an article published this week that he had \"sucked that lemon dry.\" While the prime minister might want to talk instead this week about the UK\\'s future as a leading light of the international community, he cannot escape the fact that Brexit has fundamentally changed the perception of the UK among its allies, and that it will continue to have a real-world impact both inside and outside the UK for decades to come.Kevin Liptak contributed reporting.

He hopes to create more opportunities for minorities and women to learn, and operate, in the winemaking industry.\"In basketball, you need coaches, you need staff, you need players. And the same goes for the vineyard,\" says McCollum. \"You need a farm manager, you need operations, you need all these people who specialize and can be stars in their roles.

       " 'Australian Open turmoil raises questions for Tokyo Olympics in 2021 - CNN The quarantine controversy over tennis\\' Australian Open has raised questions about whether large-scale international sporting events can take place in the middle of a pandemic and could offer a preview of the difficulties facing this summer\\'s Tokyo Olympics. sport, Australian Open turmoil raises questions for Tokyo Olympics in 2021 - CNN Australian Open turmoil raises questions for Tokyo Games Sydney  (CNN)The quarantine controversy over tennis\\' Australian Open has raised questions about whether large-scale international sporting events can take place in the middle of a pandemic and could offer a preview of the difficulties facing this summer\\'s Tokyo Olympics.Players arriving in the Australian state of Victoria have been placed into a 14-day quarantine ahead of their grand slam matches. Most have been allotted five hours each day to go out and train in strict bio-secure bubbles, but 72 players have been unable to leave their hotel rooms and cannot practice, under strict quarantine rules after passengers on their flights tested positive for Covid-19.Some tennis stars have expressed anger and frustration at being kept cooped up ahead of the first grand slam of the tennis season. They include record eight-time Australian Open men\\'s singles winner Novak Djokovic, who put forward a list of proposals that would loosen the restrictions on the quarantining stars, including moving players to houses with courts, better food, and reducing the number of days in isolation. In response, Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews said: \"People area free to provide lists of demands, but the answer is no.\"Athletes have also raised concerns over whether those who can go out and train would have an unfair advantage over their competitors who have to isolate.Read MoreCanadian player Vasek Pospisil was a passenger on one of the three flights into Melbourne that had a handful of positive Covid-19 tests from those on board, meaning he is barred from going out to train during quarantine.He told CNN that the level of risk of an entire group on a flight having to undergo strict quarantine wasn\\'t properly communicated to the players ahead of time, a claim Tennis Australia refutes. \"All the players, we understood that if somebody tested positive that it would just be the group, like if somebody in your staff tested positive, then you would have to be quarantined; you wouldn\\'t be able to practice. There wasn\\'t any discussion about the whole plane going that way, so obviously it was a huge surprise to everybody,\" he said from his hotel room in Melbourne. But many Australians appear to have little sympathy for the athletes, many of whom have flown in from coronavirus hotspots to compete for a share of total prizes worth 71.5 million Australian dollars ($55.1 million).The Victoria state capital Melbourne, the second-most populous city in Australia, was under a hard lockdown for 111 days last year. Residents contended with a curfew, closures of businesses, bans on leaving their homes, online schooling and job losses. Some Melbourne residents expressed concerns about the impact on the community once the players have left post tournament. Many are worried restrictions could be reimposed if the virus -- particularly new, potentially more transmissible variants -- managed to get into the population because of the tournament. Serbia\\'s Novak Djokovic stands on the balcony at his accommodation in Adelaide, Australia, on January 19, 2021. New cases linked to the tournamentOn Monday, Victoria reported four new Covid-19 cases, three of which are related to the Australian Open, according to the state government of Victoria. The number of people linked to the tournament that have  tested positive for the virus is now seven, after two cases were reclassified as \"shedding,\" rather than being actively infected. Among the new cases are two unnamed players and one non-playing participant. \"I think that the players are lacking perspective as they have been playing in countries where Covid is nuts,\" Melbourne resident and Grade 5 teacher Sarah Fuller told CNN. \"Melbourne, after being through so much does not want any more restrictions or hard lockdowns due to the virus getting out. So for me, it just demonstrates a lack of understanding of where they are in the world and that it\\'s a privilege to be able to play the game they do as their job.\"Like many people across the world, Fuller and her husband Trevor have had to navigate the struggles of extra hours working from home and keeping her students engaged in online learning through the pandemic. With family in another state, and the death of a grandparent, Fuller said it has been \"exhausting.\"Fuller and her husband are avid tennis fans and usually buy tickets to the Australian Open. This year, the players, she said, are experiencing just a taste of the restrictions that herself and many others have lived under during the pandemic.Australian Open tennis stars get creative with practice while stuck in hotel quarantine\"Yes it\\'s difficult, it\\'s not ideal and not normal, but nothing is \\'normal.\\' But it\\'s about keeping the community safe and what we have been able to create is a relatively Covid-free Australia.\"Australia has managed to handle the pandemic better than many countries, in part thanks to quick action from the state governments. Greater Brisbane, for example, went into a three-day lockdown earlier this month after a case of the coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom was discovered.According to the Victoria state government\\'s website on Tuesday there are 34 active cases in the region, with four internationally acquired and in quarantine in the last 24 hours, with none acquired locally in that time period.Some have pointed to the unfairness of players being able to travel and train in Melbourne while residents in other states need to apply for a permit in order to cross the internal border to Victoria. Those people who have been to \"red zones\" over the past 14 days -- including Victoria residents -- cannot reenter the state. There are also calls to prioritize the more than 38,000 Australians who remain stuck overseas, unable to return in part due to limits on daily international arrivals. Seeing the number of players and officials chartering flights into the country is likely to fuel the anger and desperation of many Australians abroad who have been waiting for months to return, many with no jobs or housing and facing financial hardships.Path to Tokyo 2020 The controversy has exposed the difficulties of operating a large international tournament ensuring strict coronavirus rules are followed, while maintaining an even playing field for competitors. All eyes will be on the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which despite being pushed back a year owing to the pandemic, has elected to keep the 2020 tag. The event will see athletes from all over the world descend on Japan this summer from July 23 to August 8, and the Paralympic Games from August 24 to September 5.Japan has signaled it is determined to go ahead with the Games. In a New Year\\'s address to Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee staff, Chairman Yoshiro Mori said that preparations would proceed \"as planned.\"Covid-19 countermeasures include athletes being tested at least once every four days and traced throughout their stay and \"contact with athletes will be kept to a minimum,\" according to an interim report published on December 2. Japan expands state of emergency and bans entry of foreign nationals as coronavirus as infections climbDetails are scant but a scheme would allow athletes \"to engage in various activities including training and participating in competitions during the 14 day self-isolation period after arrival,\" the report said. But Olympic officials are facing difficult decisions due to rising Covid-19 cases in the country. A recent poll by Japanese public broadcaster NHK found that 77% of respondents felt the Games should be postponed again or completely canceled, with only 16% in favor of holding them this year.It comes as the capital Tokyo, along with major cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu, Tochigi and Fukuoka -- covering much of Japan\\'s main island of Honshu -- have been placed under a coronavirus state of emergency. The total number of confirmed cases in Tokyo now stands at 86,674 and the city is suffering from a shortage of hospital beds for virus patients. The International Olympic Committee in December announced the opening and closing ceremonies will be pared-back in keeping with an \"overall simplification of the Games.\"Speaking to CNN last week, former top International Olympic Committee official Dick Pound said that it was unlikely the Games could be postponed again, and so any additional delay would likely mean their cancellation.\"The one-year postponement was a proposal by Japan, the Organizing Committee said \\'look, we can hold this together for another year, but not further\\',\" he said. \"Postponing it for another year, for example, will come at a huge cost, which Japan may not be willing to incur. It will further complicate a crowded sports schedule ...you\\'re going to have the World Cup and football going on, and at some point it\\'s just there\\'s just too much congestion in the overall system.\"A spokesperson for the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee said that they were \"aware of the situation\" at the Australian Open and were monitoring it, and other tournaments closely. \"Tournaments and games have been resumed in various competitions both in Japan and overseas, and the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee is learning a lot from these,\" the spokesperson said.

All four journalists have now been charged for inciting minors to protest, said DOXA, which also rejected the allegation.\"There were no calls to illegal actions in our video -- we said that young people should not be afraid to express their opinions,\" DOXA\\'s statement read. Agora, the legal organization representing the four journalists, referred CNN to DOXA\\'s statement.The Investigative Committee did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment.Navalny says he\\'s continuing hunger strike despite a high temperature and bad cough Read MoreThe four will be under strict pre-trial communications restrictions until June 14, according to a statement by Moscow\\'s Basmanny court. According to DOXA, the restrictions include a prohibition on leaving their homes between midnight and 11:59 p.m, using the internet, and communicating with anyone other than with their lawyers and close relatives.DOXA magazine started as a small online publication run mostly by students at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. It has since grown and become independent.The magazine said raids were in connection to a video taken earlier this year in which the magazine\\'s editors explained to students that it was illegal for them to be expelled from university for participating in protest actions in support of Alexey Navalny.The video was removed from the DOXA YouTube channel following a request from Russia\\'s media regulator Roskomnadzor in late January, just a a few days after it was originally posted. The watchdog argued the video encouraged participation in unauthorized protests -- a claim that DOXA disputes.\"The pressure that the journalistic community has faced lately is unprecedented, but we will not stop our activities. We will continue to highlight what is important to young people and continue to advocate for their rights,\" DOXA said in the statement.A \\'new low\\' for press freedomAmnesty International has called the raids \"a new low\" for press freedom in Russia. Russian authorities have cracked down on protesters showing support for Navalny, and hundreds of people were detained during protests in recent months. Russia has also vowed to act against social media platforms that do not take down posts which the Kremlin deemed as illegal or as inciting people to take party in \"unauthorized protests.\"Putin signs law allowing him to run for two more terms as Russian PresidentLast Friday, independent Russian investigative media outlet IStories said that the Russian intelligence agency FSB raided its offices, as well as the home of investigative journalist Roman Anin, IStories\\' editor-in-chief.Anin\\'s lawyer Anna Stavitsakaya said the raids, a brief detention and interrogation of Anin were carried out in relation to a story by Anin published in 2016.

The US could be next - CNN Europe appears to have missed its chance to stop the third wave of the coronavirus epidemic before it got out of control. Now, it\\'s paying a high price for it, with new harsh lockdowns being imposed across the continent.  europe, Coronavirus: Europe has missed its chance to stop the third wave. The US could be next - CNN Europe has missed its chance to stop the third wave. The US could be next  (CNN)Europe has missed its chance to stop the third wave of the coronavirus epidemic before it got out of control. Now it\\'s paying a high price for it, with new lockdowns being imposed across the continent. On Thursday night, France announced new restrictions on 16 regions, including Paris and Nice, though President Emmanuel Macron has refused to reimpose a national lockdown as cases soar. On Monday, large parts of Italy including the cities of Rome and Milan once again entered a strict lockdown, while in Spain, all regions except for Madrid have decided to restrict travel over the upcoming Easter holidays. The German capital of Berlin has halted the planned easing of its lockdown too, quoting a rising number of Covid-19 cases. Critics say the new restrictions have come too late and that Europe\\'s current problems can be traced back to politicians too eager to start easing.\"The second wave did not end, the lockdown was interrupted too soon, to let people go shopping for Christmas,\" French epidemiologist Catherine Hill told CNN. She said infection levels remained at a high level. \"Recently admission in intensive care units have [been increasing] regularly, and the situation is now critical in several parts of the country, including greater Paris.\"New coronavirus variants keep popping up. Here\\'s what we know about themRead MoreA more contagious variant of the virus, known as B.1.1.7, seems to be the common culprit behind the chaos. New preliminary data published in the British Medical Journal suggest that the strain, first detected last year in the United Kingdom, may also be more deadly. Alessandro Grimaldi, the director of infectious diseases at Salvatore Hospital in the Italian town of L\\'Aquila, told CNN the new more contagious variant had \"changed the game,\" adding that \"inevitably, the measures taken to prevent the infection have to become more drastic.\"World Health Organization warned about this nearly two months ago, when it became clear the UK variant was circulating in most of Europe. \"Once it becomes dominant, it may impact the epidemic curve overall and lead to the need for a more restrictive approach to the public health and social measures that need to be in place, so that rates of transmission can decrease,\" WHO\\'s Senior Emergency Officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said at the time. That has now happened. Germany\\'s center for disease control announced on March 10 that the UK variant had become the dominant strain in Germany. The new variant is also responsible for the majority of new cases in France and Italy, according to health officials there. In Spain, B.1.1.7 is now the dominant strain in nine of the country\\'s 19 regions.The worsening situation in Europe is becoming a cautionary tale for the United States. The variant causing a renewed crisis across the continent is also spreading fast in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has projected it will become the dominant strain in the United States by the end of this month or early April.But there is another reason why US experts are worried about what is happening in Europe right now. Germany, France, Italy and Spain all avoided the huge spikes in infections that had paralyzed the United Kingdom after the Christmas holiday. Their infection levels were either stable or or showing signs of decline just a few weeks ago. With vaccination rollouts starting, albeit slowly, across the continent, people were starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.But while the trends looked promising, the case numbers were still very high. And that became a major problem when the new wave started -- making the new lockdowns necessary, Grimaldi said.\"It\\'s not easy to do lockdowns, because of the economic despair it brings ... the life style change it brings,\" he said. \"But they are indispensable in trying to make the virus stop.\"He said that data from a recent study by the University in Bologna has shown that the most stringent lockdown measures, refered to as \"the red zones\" in Italy do work -- leading to as much as 91% drop in number of Covid-related deaths.A delay in the decision to impose lockdowns can be deadly. The Resolution Foundation, a British think tank, said Thursday that an extra 27,000 people died of Covid-19 because the government delayed the start of the country\\'s latest lockdown until January, despite evidence of fast rising cases in December.A man walks near a closed bar in Piazza Vittorio in Turin on March 17, 2021.American public health officials are worried the US is heading in the same direction -- with some states starting to ease up on safety measures even as case numbers remain high. \"When you see a plateau at a level as high as 60,000 cases a day, that is a very vulnerable time to have a surge, to go back up. That\\'s what exactly happened in Europe,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN. He observed that after promising declines in Covid-19 numbers, some European countries \"pulled back on public health measures\" which has led to the new spikes.Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease modeling expert at the University Warwick and a UK government scientific adviser, said that the slower rollout of vaccines in many European countries means they are facing a higher risk of seeing large waves of new cases. \"Sadly until nations get close to herd immunity we are likely to see waves of infection occurring as countries cycle between phases of lockdown,\" he said.Grimaldi said that while vaccination plays a major role in fighting the epidemic, it has to come hand-in-hand with the safety measures, because the more the virus keeps circulating in the population, the higher the chance it could mutate further. \"The virus will try to survive despite the vaccine, so lockdowns are really the only way to stop the virus from circulating,\" he said. Without a global vaccine plan, coronavirus variants could lead to untold number of deathsThe World Health Organization on Thursday warned that Europe\\'s vaccination campaigns aren\\'t yet slowing transmission of the coronavirus. The continent recorded more than 1.2 million new infections last week, and more than 20,000 people a week are dying of Covid-19. \"The number of people dying from COVID-19 in Europe is higher now than it was this time last year, reflecting the widespread hold this virus has,\" Dr. Hans Kluge, the WHO\\'s regional director for Europe, said.And the pandemic is \"moving eastwards,\" Kluge added, with infection rates and deaths in central Europe, the Balkans and Baltic states among the highest in the world.A new model published in The Lancet journal on Thursday showed that vaccinations alone might not be enough to contain the epidemic, stressing the need for gradual easing of the restrictions rather than a big bang reopening.Hill, the French epidemiologist, added that testing must also remain a key part of the strategy. \"To control the epidemic one needs to test massively the population in order to find and isolate the carriers of the virus,\" she said, pointing to the estimated 50% of infections that are caused by individuals who do not know they have Covid-19.The new wave of higher case numbers isn\\'t limited to Europe. Case numbers have increased 10% globally over the past week to over 3 million new reported cases, according to WHO\\'s latest situation report. The number of new cases peaked in early January, but then declined for four weeks in row before increased for the past three weeks. The number of people dying is still declining and has dropped to below 60,000 per week last week, the first time this happened since early November.

Read MoreThe UK will also introduce testing for school pupils. \"We\\'re introducing twice weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils and asking them to wear face coverings for the rest of this term,\" Johnson said at a press conference on Monday.Step one will also have a second phase on March 29, where further restrictions will be lifted, allowing groups of six to meet outside and two households to mix.Boris Johnson\\'s government is \\'gaslighting\\' Britain about the realities of Brexit, critics sayThe lifting of measures will take place with a minimum five-week gap, the Prime Minister said, allowing four weeks for the government to gather the appropriate data and one week to alert the public and sectors involved.The speed at which England will exit lockdown will be set against four key tests: how the vaccine rollout is going; how vaccines are affecting hospitalizations and deaths; that infection rates are staying low; and that new variants not undermining the other three criteria.Step two, which would happen no earlier than April 12, will see the return of non-essential retail, such as hairdressers, gyms, museums, zoos and theme parks. Social contact rules will remain in place for indoor activities, meaning that they can only be attended by the members of own household. Crucially, the hospitality sector will also be allowed to reopen at this point. Pubs and restaurants will only be allowed to serve groups of six or two households outside, however. Downing Street said that there would be no curfews or restrictions on what customers would be able to order after heavy criticism last summer.Step three, which will be in place no sooner than May 17, will remove most social distancing rules. Groups of up to 30 will be able to meet outdoors in a public space or private garden. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to serve indoors, though the rule of six will apply. Indoor entertainment will also be allowed to resume, with venues allowed to host up to 1,000 people. Spectators will be allowed to return to live outdoor sports, with up to 10,000 allowed to attend the largest venues, such as Wembley Stadium.UK study finds one dose of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reduces risk of infection by 72%Finally, step four, which will happen no sooner than June 12, will see the removal of most social restrictions and the return of nightclubs. Personal life events like weddings will have no limitations if things go well. In the weeks and months leading up to step four, the government will carry out reviews on large outdoor events, such as music festivals. The government will look at controversial measures such as Covid certification for people who test negative or have been vaccinated. International travel will not return until at least May 17 and travel between the UK\\'s four nations will be discussed between the devolved governments.The measures, while welcomed by most, will be deemed slow and in some cases controversial, so Johnson is likely to meet resistance from his own Conservative lawmakers when they come before a vote in Parliament.\"Today\\'s pace of change will be a hammer blow to aviation, pubs, restaurants, hotels, gyms and pools, the arts and entertainment,\" Conservative MP Steve Baker said in a statement Monday.\"Once again, it seems to be modeling not data driving decisions.\" The news comes as the UK\\'s vaccine rollout continues to lead the rest of Europe, while scientific research indicates that vaccinations lower the risk of hospitalization up to 94%. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh, the University of Strathclyde and Public health Scotland examined data from people who had received the first dose of the either the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine. The data showed that four weeks after having the shot, the risk of being admitted to hospitals had been reduced by up to 85% and 94% respectively, according to UK news agency PA Media. As of Monday morning, the UK has given first doses to 17.5 million people, while the speed at which it can vaccinate is increasing.Also on Monday, new data from Public Health England showed that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine \"provides high levels of protection against infection and symptomatic disease.\" The research, which was carried out on healthcare workers aged under the age of 65, found that one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 72% after three weeks, while two vaccine doses reduced the risk of infection by 85%.Despite the vaccine rollout, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said Monday that Covid-19 would likely be a problem over the next few winters.\"This is something that we have to see for the long term and, in my view, is likely to be a problem in particular during the winter for the next few winters,\" Whitty said.He explained that, just as flu and pneumonia still cause serious illness and fatalities every year, so will Covid-19\"I am afraid, for the foreseeable future, the coronavirus is going to be added to that list of things that those who are vulnerable, even despite vaccination, can be at risk of,\" he said. \"We vaccinate against flu, we vaccinate against pneumococcal pneumonia and still there are cases and there are deaths.\"Whitty added: \"I think people need to see it in that way... this is something where the vaccination will take the rates right down but they will not get rid of this.\"Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly implied that PHE\\'s Siren Study analyzed symptomatic Covid-19 disease. It was carried out on healthcare workers aged under the age of 65 regardless of symptoms. This has been corrected.',\n",

Democrats lost the 2016 presidential election, and they barely won in 2020. Part of their problem was declining support among White voters. politics, Democrats\\' problem with Hispanic voters isn\\'t going away as GOP gains seem to be solidifying - CNNPolitics Democrats\\' problem with Hispanic voters isn\\'t going away as GOP gains seem to be solidifying  (CNN)The Democratic Party\\'s early 2000s dream of an emerging majority based on a diversifying electorate has run into reality. Democrats lost the 2016 presidential election, and they barely won in 2020. Part of their problem was declining support among White voters.But the 2020 election also pointed to another problem: Hispanic voters (who are growing as a portion of the electorate) moving toward the Republican Party. Recent polling -- and now this week\\'s Texas primaries -- show that these Republican gains don\\'t seem to be going away anytime soon.Texas is a heavily Hispanic state relative to the country as a whole. There are 16 counties in Texas where Hispanics make up at least 80% of the citizen voting age population, according to the latest data available from Census Bureau. The county with the highest percentage of Hispanic adult citizens (Starr County) backed now-President Joe Biden by 5 points in 2020, after voting for Hillary Clinton by 60 points four years earlier. (That\\'s not a misprint. It really was a 55-point swing.)Regularly scheduled primaries, of course, don\\'t feature a Democratic candidate versus a Republican candidate. We can, however, look at the relative turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries. This is instructive in Texas where voters don\\'t register by party and can choose which party\\'s primary to vote in.Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump\\'s inroads in South TexasAll told, 27% of the Texans who voted Tuesday in the 16 most Hispanic counties cast a ballot in the Republican primary. This may not seem like a lot but consider that in 2018, just 15% of those who voted in either the Democratic or Republican primary cast a ballot on the Republican side.Read MoreIn Starr County, 24% of primary votes were cast on the Republican side Tuesday. It was basically nothing in 2018, with a mere 0.2% of primary votes being cast on the Republican side. That\\'s a 24-point shift.Compare this with what happened statewide in Texas this year. There was slight movement toward Republicans: Of the votes cast on the Democratic or Republican side, 65% were Republican primary votes. In 2018, it was 60%. This was a 4-point shift without rounding.Put another way, the shift in Republican primary participation in those 16 heavily Hispanic counties was nearly three times the statewide shift.More signs of a shiftTexas, though, is only one state. Further, it\\'s just a primary.But even on the national level, Texas does not seem to be that much of an outlier.While it\\'s not clear that Hispanic Americans have moved even more toward the Republicans relative to how Americans overall are shifting, it\\'s clear that Republicans are holding their gains from 2020.Trump made big in-roads in Hispanic areas across the nationNationally, the three polls that meet CNN standards for reporting (CNN/SSRS, Fox and Quinnipiac University) have produced generic congressional ballot results since the beginning of the year and provided a crosstab on Hispanic voters\\' midterm preferences. The generic ballot asks respondents some form of the following question: \"If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican Party?\"Democrats have held a 23-point advantage among Hispanics on the generic congressional ballot in the average of these polls so far this year.An average of three estimates of how Americans voted in House races in 2020 (Catalist, the CNN exit poll and the Pew Research Center) found that Democrats won the House vote by about 28 points in 2020 among Hispanics.This 5-point shift toward Republicans among Hispanics is in line with the 5-point shift we see among voters overall -- Republicans ahead by 2 points on the generic congressional ballot, compared with losing the national House vote by 3 points in 2020.The key thing to realize, though, is that Democrats did worse -- and Republicans did better -- among Hispanic voters in 2020 House races relative to the national vote than in any House election since 2004. So while not losing additional ground is not a bad thing for Democrats, it\\'s not a good thing either.The Biden factorIf anything, the picture gets better for Republicans when you examine Biden\\'s popularity. Across the CNN, Fox and Quinnipiac polls this year, the President\\'s net approval rating averages +2 points with Hispanic Americans. That\\'s 17 points better than his net approval rating with voters overall in these polls (-15 points).CNN Poll: Most Biden detractors say he\\'s done nothing they like since becoming presidentIn the 2020 election, Biden\\'s margin with Hispanic voters was about 23 points better than it was overall.So compared with 2020, Biden is doing worse with Hispanics relative to how he is doing with voters overall. That\\'s notable given that earlier in his presidency, Biden was doing significantly better among Hispanics relative to how he was doing overall and compared with how he did in 2020.This fits with an analysis from FiveThirtyEight\\'s Geoffrey Skelley, which found that Biden\\'s approval rating had fallen disproportionately among Hispanics over the course of his presidency.The fact that the political preferences of Hispanic Americans are jumping around may get at something larger: Their votes are up for grabs more so than the average voter\\'s. While they may still be more Democratic-leaning, both parties have a good chance of making up ground among the Hispanic electorate.I\\'d expect a lot of attention to be focused on this growing bloc of voters in the midterms.',\n",

The European Union and several other nations increased pledges to cut greenhouse gases and reach carbon neutrality at a virtual climate change summit hosted by US President Joe Biden in April. But there have been concerns over whether world leaders would win the backings of their parliaments to actually enshrine the pledges into law. Until Monday, only five countries had actually made their pledges legally binding, according to Climate Watch Data: The United Kingdom and New Zealand, as well as EU members Hungary, Luxembourg and France.Health risks from heat waves send a climate alarmMonday\\'s approval of the package of policies is the final seal on the climate law, which the EU\\'s parliament passed last week. The EU has been working toward this law since it launched its vision, under the European Green Deal, in 2019. \"I warmly welcome this final step of the adoption of the EU\\'s very first climate law which enshrines into legislation the 2050 climate neutrality objective,\" said Portuguese Minister of Environment and Climate Action João Pedro Matos Fernandes in a statement. Portugal is currently holding the presidency of the EU. Read More\"An agreement on the European climate law has been a priority for the Portuguese Presidency and I am glad that we have successfully brought it over the finishing line.\"Net zero is a scenario where the number of greenhouse gases emitted are no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere, largely through a method known as carbon capture. Some scientists and environmentalists criticize net zero plans for relying too heavily on technology that isn\\'t fully developed, arguing the world should be aiming to cut the use of fossil fuels entirely and aim for low-  or zero-carbon economies.The new law seeks to limit its reliance on carbon capture by capping the amount to 225 megatons of carbon. It will also seek to become a negative carbon economy -- where it removes more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits -- after 2050.Britain still lacks a plan to hit its bold climate goalsThe European Commission also agreed to propose an intermediate climate target for 2040, \"if appropriate,\" within six months after a first \"global stocktake\" of emissions carried out under the Paris Agreement. The law states that a scientific board on climate change will be established to advise the EU on its policies.The current increase in pledges from the EU -- as well as other countries, including the US and UK -- are aimed at keeping average global temperature rises within 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial levels and well below 2 degrees. The International Panel of Climate Change paints a catastrophic picture in a 2-degree-rise scenario, where 1.7 billion more people experience severe heatwaves at least once every five years, sea levels rise by another 10 centimeters and coral reefs are all but wiped out, among other impacts.But some environmentalists have warned that even the more ambitious pledges do not go far enough, and are not enough to keep temperature rise to 1.5C.',\n",

Since Rafiq\\'s allegations, Yorkshire CCC apologized and said that Rafiq was the \"victim of inappropriate behaviour\" while playing for the club, although no one was disciplined following an investigation into the allegations by an independent panel.In a statement on Friday reported by the BBC\\'s Dan Roan, Hutton said: \"The club should have recognised at the time the serious allegations of racism. I am sorry that we could not persuade Executive members of the Board to recognise the gravity of the situation and show care and contrition.\"I remain disappointed that legal restrictions, including an ongoing employment tribunal, have prevented the investigation report from being published and look forward to the time that everyone can see its recommendations.

But new scientific evidence suggests that\\'s not what happened. Genomic testing shows at least two of the Australian\\'s babies likely died from a previously undiscovered genetic mutation that led to heart complications -- meaning she may have been wrongfully imprisoned for almost two decades. The finding has prompted 90 scientists -- including two Australian Nobel Laureates -- to ask the governor of New South Wales to pardon Folbigg and let her walk free. If that happens, Folbigg\\'s case will be one of the worst miscarriages of justice in Australian history.The ramifications don\\'t end there.Read MoreWhile scientists are still learning about the causes of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) -- an umbrella term for when children die suddenly from unexplained causes -- the findings in Folbigg\\'s case may help other parents who are grieving the unexpected loss of their own children.Early yearsRight from the start, Folbigg\\'s life was marred by tragedy.

Then, when he was just 19 days old, Caleb died. The cause of death was given as SIDS -- essentially, the absence of evidence of any other cause. Folbigg soon fell pregnant again, and in 1990 she had another son, Patrick. Tests showed he was normal and healthy. But at four months, he had an unexplained ALTE, an apparent life-threatening event, that left him with brain damage and seizures. Four months later, he died as a consequence of seizures.Her third child, Sarah, died age 10 months -- her cause of death was listed as SIDS. When her fourth daughter, Laura, died age 18 months on March 1, 1999, police started investigating. The couple\\'s marriage broke down. After Folbigg left, her husband found her diary and read an entry that he said made him want to vomit. He took the diary to police on May 19, 1999, according to the inquiry. On April 19, 2001, Folbigg was arrested and charged with four counts of murder.Her childhood best friend Tracy Chapman describes Folbigg as a caring animal lover who was a \"really good mom.\" But at trial in 2003, the prosecution argued Folbigg had smothered her children. There was no conclusive forensic proof -- instead, the prosecution relied on a maxim credited to British pediatrician Roy Meadow: \"One sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder, until proven otherwise.\"The prosecutor compared the chance of the children dying of natural causes to pigs flying. \"I can\\'t disprove that one day some piglets might be born with wings and that they might fly. Is that some reasonable doubt? No,\" the prosecutor told the jury during the 2003 trial. \"There has never ever been before in the history of medicine that our experts have been able to find any case like this. It is preposterous. It is not a reasonable doubt. It is a fantasy and, of course, the Crown does not have to disprove a fanciful idea.\"  The prosecution pointed to Folbigg\\'s journals, which they said contained virtual admissions of guilt.\"I feel like the worst mother on this Earth, scared that (Laura) will leave me now, like Sarah did. I knew I was short tempered and cruel sometimes to her and she left, with a bit of help,\" Folbigg wrote in one. \"It can\\'t happen again. I\\'m ashamed of myself. I can\\'t tell (my husband) about it because he\\'ll worry about leaving her with me.\"Craig Folbigg speaks to media outside the Supreme Court on May 21, 2001. Folbigg didn\\'t confess, there was no obvious motive, and no one claimed to have seen her murder her children. But the jury found her guilty of the murder of three children and the manslaughter of one. Folbigg was eventually sentenced on appeal to 30 years in prison with a non-parole period of 25 years. By the time she is eligible for parole, Folbigg will be 60 years old.  The fight to get her outThe term SIDS was introduced in 1969 as a way to categorize the unexplainable. By the 1980s, cases that might have been classified as homicides in the past were attributed to SIDS, UK pediatric pathologist John L. Emery noted in a 1985 paper. By the 1990s, scientists had developed a model demonstrating that a range of factors lead to SIDS, including exposure to smoke and sleeping position.Over the past two decades, however, there has been a growing understanding of genetic factors. One of the first studies into this came in 2001, when Mayo Clinic pediatric cardiologist Michael Ackerman and a team of scientists linked a mutation in the SCN5A gene to SIDS. Since then, genetic variations in more than 30 different genes have been linked to SIDS and sudden unexpected deaths in children (SUDC) -- a term for children who die when they are more than one year old. Studies now indicate up to 35% of SIDS cases may be explained by genetic factors, although the cause of the majority of cases remains unclear.In 2015, with her appeals exhausted, Folbigg\\'s lawyers submitted a petition to the governor of New South Wales, asking him to direct that an inquiry be held into her convictions. The lawyers argued new evidence had come to light since her unsuccessful appeals -- including a growing understanding of SIDS -- that lead to a \"feeling of disquiet\" over her convictions. If the former NSW District Court chief judge Reginald Blanch, who headed the inquiry, agreed, he could refer the case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Kathleen Folbigg was questioned again about the deaths of her four children during an inquiry in 2019. As part of that inquiry, Folbigg\\'s legal team approached Prof. Carola Vinuesa, co-director of the Centre for Personalised Immunology at Australian National University, to ask her to sequence the children\\'s genomes to see if there was a genetic mutation that could have caused SIDS. \"There was a chance -- even though it might be a long shot -- that (Folbigg) was carrying something that might be passed on to the children,\" Vinuesa said. \"To my knowledge, this is the first case in which a court (anywhere in the world) has used whole genome sequencing to find evidence of a cause of death.\"During the inquiry, Vinuesa and her team sequenced Folbigg\\'s genome and found a previously unreported variation in the CALM2 gene which controls how calcium is transported in and out of heart cells. Studies have found variations in the CALM 2 genes can cause heart problems in young children, meaning they are among the best recognized causes of SIDS and SUDC. When they sequenced the genomes of all four children, they found both daughters carried the same CALM2 mutation as their mother. After the inquiry had closed, more evidence came to light, prompting Vinuesa and her team to write to the judge telling him it was likely the daughters died as a result of the variant. Despite the new finding, Judge Blanch opted not to reopen the inquiry. After taking all the evidence -- including the diaries -- into account, Blanch said he remained of the view Folbigg had smothered Sarah and Laura.New developmentsLast November, scientists published even more compelling evidence.Led by Danish professor Michael Toft Overgaard, a team of experts across six countries found the CALM2 variant in Folbigg and her two girls could cause disease -- just like other CALM2 variants. They concluded the variant altered the girls\\' heart rhythm, making them susceptible to heart conditions -- particularly given the medication they were given. Sarah was on antibiotics for a cough, while Laura was being treated with paracetamol and pseudoephedrine for a respiratory infection shortly before she died. Laura had inflammation of the heart when she died to the extent that three professors said they would have listed it as her cause of death. \"We consider the variant likely precipitated the natural deaths of the two female children,\" the researchers wrote in a study published in November 2020 in medical journal EP Europace. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To my knowledge, this is the first case in which a court (anywhere in the world) has used whole genome sequencing to find evidence of a cause of death.\"Professor Carola Vineusa\\n\\n\\nIn both of the boys, scientists found other variations in their BSN, also known as Bassoon, genes -- one variant had been inherited from their mother, and the other likely from their father, although he refused to provide a sample to the researchers. When both copies of the BSN gene are defective in mice it can cause them to die young during epileptic fits. Scientists are still investigating whether this variant could have caused the two boys\\' deaths. Patrick experienced seizures before he died. Only 75 people in the world are known to carry mutations in their CALM1, CALM2 or CALM3 genes that have been shown to be lethal in children. But while genetic mutations that cause SIDS may be rare in the general population, once a parent has a genetic mutation there is a high chance of them passing it on, Vinuesa says.\"In the end it\\'s not about these variations being very rare in the world, it\\'s about the chances of Kathleen meeting someone like Craig and having this combination of mutations between both of them. Once genetics come into play, statistics go out the window,\" Vinuesa added.  Vinuesa said the case shows that contrary to what was suggested at trial, there doesn\\'t need to be one explanation for all four of the deaths.\"The pathology already told us there were different causes,\" Vinuesa said. The research hasn\\'t yet freed Folbigg, but it has already had an impact. Folbigg\\'s lawyers launched a case in the New South Wales Court of Appeal, arguing that the commissioner of the 2019 inquiry incorrectly applied the law to his decisions. The genome findings also prompted a petition with more than 90 signatures to the New South Wales governor earlier this month. \"It is deeply concerning that medical and scientific evidence has been ignored in preference of circumstantial evidence. We now have an alternative explanation for the death of the Folbigg children,\" Prof. Fiona Stanley, who has been recognized for her work on child health, said in a statement at the time of the petition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The reality is, Kath\\'s lost four children. And she hasn\\'t been allowed to grieve as a mother should.\"Tracy Chapman\\n\\n\\nA spokesperson for Gov. Margaret Beazley said the state\\'s attorney general is considering the petition and will advise her. According to New South Wales\\' Department of Communities and Justice, few people have ever received a pardon by the state. Even if Folbigg is freed, her legal fight may not be over. She will need to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal to get her conviction overturned if she wants to clear her name -- and it will be another legal matter again if she wants to get compensation for the years she\\'s spent in prison. For Folbigg, the research offers some hope -- but it was also emotional for her to hear, says Chapman, who talks to Folbigg every day.\"You\\'re being told potentially the thing that you carried has been passed onto the children. So that\\'s emotionally quite heart-wrenching,\" Chapman said. \"The reality is, Kath\\'s lost four children. And she hasn\\'t been allowed to grieve as a mother should.\" Science in the court roomFolbigg\\'s case is part of a bigger picture -- a growing understanding of SIDS, a changing view about what multiple deaths in a family means, and a wider criticism of how science is presented in the courtroom. Much of Folbigg\\'s conviction was based on a maxim credited to Meadows that three infant deaths are murder, unless proven otherwise -- a maxim that had already started to draw skepticism. Two women in the United Kingdom convicted on the basis of Meadow\\'s maxim had their convictions overturned in 2003. In one of those cases, the appeal judge said: \"Unless we are sure of guilt, the dreadful possibility always remains that a mother, already brutally scarred by the unexplained death or deaths of her babies, may find herself in prison for life for killing them when she should not be there at all. \"In our community, and in any civilized community, that is abhorrent.\"In a similar case to Folbigg\\'s, Australian woman Carol Matthey was accused of murdering her four children between 1998 and 2003, but the case against her was dropped due to a lack of evidence -- even though the same experts that testified against Folbigg were set to do so against Matthey. In 2019, Judge Blanch said after taking all the evidence into the account he still believed that Kathleen Folbigg smothered Sarah and Laura.\"(Folbigg) could very well be innocent,\" Matthey told the \"60 Minutes\" TV show. \"Medical experts get things wrong, police get things wrong.\"Gary Edmond, a law professor at the University of New South Wales who is an expert in trial evidence and forensic science, said it was unfortunate Folbigg went to trial when she did. If she was tried a few years later, when the doubt over Meadow\\'s maxim was better established, the courts might have been more cautious about admitting the expert evidence used to convict her, he said. But even now, the way Australian courts handle evidence is outdated -- and lagging behind United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, Edmond said. While other jurisdictions assess whether science is reliable before it comes to court, Australia\\'s system leaves it up to the juries to decide what\\'s valid. That\\'s a problem because juries don\\'t have enough knowledge to make complex scientific judgments, Edmond said. Folbigg\\'s lawyer Rhanee Rego -- who has been working on her case for almost five years unpaid -- agrees courts need to be careful about which experts are allowed to give evidence. \"I think that one of the biggest lessons we can take from this case is that we need to listen more carefully in the legal system to peer-reviewed and evidence-based science and medicine,\" she said.Genetic answersThe advances in genetic testing -- including the findings in Folbigg\\'s case -- could also help give answers for others dealing with the unexplained deaths of their children.  Vinuesa says it\\'s likely that in the next few years, other families who have experienced SIDS will find a genetic mutation is to blame.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We need to listen more carefully in the legal system to peer reviewed and evidence-based science and medicine.\"Rhanee Rego\\n\\n\\n\"In most families where there have been SIDS deaths, nobody has yet gone back and sequenced the genomes of the children,\" she said. As molecular autopsies become more common, she thinks there will be more genetic explanations for otherwise unexplained deaths. That could help families looking for answers -- and also help those worried about being targeted by the law. \"Many families live in fear, because they\\'ve had two or more children dying and they\\'re worried that one day someone will be knocking at their door with some type of police investigation,\" she said. \"We know now that when you have a genetic condition ... it\\'s not rare.\" Chapman says her childhood friend hopes her case helps other parents explain otherwise unexplainable deaths.\"It\\'s not just about having Kath free,\" Chapman says. \"The most important thing after Kath is freed is that this never happens to anybody else ever again.\"',\n",

Okoro was awarded her 4x400m relay Olympic bronze medal at the Anniversary Games at the London Stadium in 2018.Read MoreOver the last decade, she\\'s also competed in a variety of European and World Championships, collecting a total of three silvers and four more bronze.\\'I can see your veins\\'But as she looks back at her career, Okoro reflects perhaps bronze and silver were not quite good enough. Come to think of it, perhaps even a gold medal wouldn\\'t have been good enough.She also wants to start a wider conversation about the issues surrounding women and body acceptance.Okoro says she started to feel that she wasn\\'t just having to compete on the track. She was having to compete with people\\'s expectations and demands as to what an athlete should look like.According to Okoro, that look was skinny, slender and tall. \"Oh, I can see your veins, this must mean you\\'re in good shape,\" Okoro recalls a conversation she had with coach Charles van Commenee, who worked with the British Athletics team for a number of years, during the prep camp leading into the 2010 European Championships. Okoro says that Van Commenee then asked her about her weight.\"Proudly, I was like \\'60 kilograms,\\'\" replied Okoro, who considers that her personal ideal race weight.Okoro says that is 15kg heavier than the other athletes she raced against, placing her above traditional weight threshold norms in track and field.According to Okoro, Van Commenee then responded: \"Oh, you must be heavy boned!\"Van Commenee, who now works as a motivational speaker on \"high performance culture,\" told CNN Sport: \"Being too light or being too heavy can cause injuries and therefore the staff, led by the head coach, has a duty to address this issue.\"It would be unprofessional to turn a blind eye but obviously the right words and the right tone have to be used in addressing the issue,\" he added. Okoro competes in the 800 metres event of the Norwich Union 2006 International Athletics competition at the Alexander stadium, in Birmingham, 20 August 2006. Okoro came fourth with a time of 2.03.08 minutes.After the championships, Okoro says she began working with a nutritionist and was advised to go on a zero-carb diet.\"I just thought, \\'Okay, you\\'ve just taken out all my carbs, so I\\'m going to have no energy\\' ... You start to doubt yourself.\"Speaking specifically about Okoro, Van Commenee said he doesn\\'t want to have a public debate with the track and field athlete. He continued: \"If she has a problem with anything I may or may not have said, I expect her to speak with me, which she has not done.\" However, Van Commenee recalled one conversation with his former athlete where he described Okoro \"ranting about her non-selection for the 800m\" at the 2012 London Olympics adding: \"It was a very painful experience for her.\"Okoro remembers the conversation differently.\"In 2012, Charles and I had an exchange regarding selections, well, he was just shouting at me in the training facility which embarrassed me.\"The 35-year-old Okoro added: \"It was two days before the British trials and the press got a hold of it as it potentially affected my (poor) performance at the championships and ran with the story.\"Okoro emphasized that it wasn\\'t to do with her weight on this occasion.\"It was more to do with him having to have his way and throw his dominance around,\" she said.Britain\\'s Lee Mcconnell, Christine Ohuruogu, Nicola Sanders and Okoro celebrate on the podium after the women\\'s 4x400m relay final, 02 September 2007, at the 11th IAAF World Athletics Championships, in Osaka.

       " 'What is Novichok, the rare nerve agent used in Russian spy attack  - CNN Novichok, the substance used in the attempted murder of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, is not merely lethal, it\\'s also highly unusual.  europe, What is Novichok, the rare nerve agent used in Russian spy attack  - CNN Russian spy attack nerve agent was rare, dangerous and sophisticated  (CNN)It\\'s been described as among the deadliest chemical weapons ever made. But Novichok, the substance confirmed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to have been used in the attempted murder of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, is not merely lethal, it\\'s also highly unusual. It\\'s so unusual in fact, that very few scientists outside of Russia have any real experience in dealing with it. The substance, which means \"newcomer\" in Russian, was first developed in secret by the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s, as a means of countering US chemical weapons defenses. Its existence remained secret until the mid-nineties, when information regarding its production was revealed as part of a deliberate leak by disgruntled Soviet scientist and whistle-blower Vil Mirzayanov. Even today, no country outside of Russia is known to have developed the substance. Read MoreIt\\'s that information that helped the UK Government conclude it was \"highly likely\" that either Russia tried to kill Skripal directly, or it had lost control of the nerve agent.Military personnel wearing protective suits investigate the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England. \\'Russian hands all over it\\'Speaking to CNN, chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon described Novichok as \"a very sophisticated chemical weapon\" that only a very select number of states would be capable of handling.\"It is difficult to imagine a scenario that doesn\\'t have Russian hands all over it,\" said de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK military\\'s Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.\"So, the chance that perhaps some of these Novichoks have been stolen by criminals or terrorists from Russia is a possibility, and we wait to see an explanation from the Russian Ambassador to London tomorrow, but I think highly unlikely.\" Investigators in biohazard suits at the bench where \\nthe Skripals were found unconscious.What is Novichok?According to Professor Gary Stephens, pharmacology expert at the University of Reading, Novichok is a more \"dangerous and sophisticated\" nerve agent than sarin which has been used in chemical weapons attacks in Syria, or VX, which was used to assassinate Kim Jong Nam, the brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at an airport in Malaysia last year. It is also harder to identify. \"One of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list,\" said Stephens, referring to the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international arms control treaty signed in 1993 that prohibits the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons.\"It means the chemicals that are mixed to create it are much easier to deliver with no risk to the health of the courier,\" said Stephens.A colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid, Novichok would be easy to transport, suggested de Bretton-Gordon, who described it as likely going undetected \"through an airport or a seaport or even through the mail.\"How it worksLike other nerve agents, Novichok works by causing a slowing of the heart and restriction of the airways, leading to a slow and often painful death by asphyxiation.Andrea Sella, professor of chemistry at University College London, described Novichok as causing a \"systemic collapse of many bodily functions.\"\"In essence what they do is to block the mechanism that allows a nerve to reset itself after a signal has been transmitted,\" said Sella, adding that the symptoms were largely consistent, \"especially the labored breathing and the muscular rigidity.\" There is no treatment, only supportive care, including oxygen, anti-seizure medication, atropine, used for some poisoning patients, and pralidoxime chloride, given to inhibit poisoning including by nerve agents. Even just small doses can cause confusion and drowsiness.\"Treatment involves supporting breathing and delivering pharmaceuticals that on the one hand moderate the behavior of the nervous system and that can reverse the action of the agent,\" said Sella. \"It is likely that there will be long-term neurological problems for a person who has been exposed to these agents.\"Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain hospitalized in critical condition. A police officer who came into contact with the nerve agent, Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, remains hospitalized in serious condition but has been speaking to visitors.Police activity in Salisbury, England Wednesday March 7, 2018, around the home of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal.How and where it was ingestedThe next question facing the UK government is how precisely the attack was administered -- and how the Skripals ingested the agent.According to the medical handbook, Responding to Terrorism, published in 2010, Novichok nerve agents \"may be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder as opposed to a gas or a vapor,\" with the main route of exposure thought to be by inhalation, although \"absorption may also occur via skin or mucous membrane exposure.\"According to the book\\'s authors, professors Ian Greaves and Paul Hunt, the Novochok class of agent was reportedly engineered to be undetectable by standard detection equipment, meaning further investigation may prove to be difficult.  On Friday, an additional 180 military personnel were deployed to the scene to help police investigate several sites amid concerns over potential contamination.This was followed yesterday by the removal of the restaurant table where Sergei and Yulia Skripal ate on the day of attack for examination, a source confirmed to CNN. Restaurant employees were also advised to wash their uniforms, but not to burn them.However, in spite of the extreme toxicity of these compounds, there would be very little risk to the general population, suggested professor Salla. \"There is no way of spreading the material around and it would decompose relatively swiftly in damp conditions,\" said Salla, who described the attempted murder as a \"highly targeted attack.\"CNN\\'s Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report',\n",

India has not condemned the invasion of Ukraine and abstained from voting at the United Nations calling out Russia\\'s aggression. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a \"special operation\" to demilitarize and \"denazify\" the country.One person within India\\'s security apparatus said the West understood India\\'s position, given that it needs to keep its armed forces well supplied amid simmering territorial disputes with China.India, which imports 80% of its oil needs, usually buys only about 2% to 3% from Russia. But with oil prices up 40% so far this year, the government is looking at increasing this if it can help reduce its rising energy bill.Read More\"Russia is offering oil and other commodities at a heavy discount. We will be happy to take that,\" one of the Indian government officials said.Russia could default on its debt within daysThe official added that such trade required preparatory work including transportation, insurance cover and getting the right blend of crude, but once that was done India would take Russia up on its offer.The officials, who declined to be identified, did not say how much oil was on offer or what the discount was.The finance ministry did not reply to an email seeking comment.Reuters has reported that Indian officials are trying to set up a rupee-ruble mechanism with Russia to continue bilateral trade. Russia has urged what it describes as friendly nations to maintain trade and investment ties.Apart from oil, India is also looking for cheaper fertilizer from Russia and its ally Belarus, according to one of the officials.\\'Complicated history\\'Indian officials said they could not suddenly replace Russia with other suppliers, particularly in the defense sector.India\\'s dependence on Russia for its military hardware still runs as high as 60%, despite a significant reduction over the last decade.U.S. officials have declined to say if India would be sanctioned should Russia send S-400 missile systems as part of a $5.5 billion deal signed in 2018 for five of them.Initial supplies of the system started late last year despite a U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware.Ely Ratner, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, told a U.S. Congress hearing last week that India was diversifying its defense suppliers.\"We recognize that India has a complicated history and relationship with Russia. The majority of the weapons that they buy are from the Russians,\" he said.\"The good news is that they are in a multi-year process of diversifying their arms purchases away from Russia -- that\\'s going to take some time. But they are clearly committed to doing that, including the indigenization of their own defense industry and that\\'s something we should support.\"British Foreign Minister Liz Truss also said last week that London should pursue closer economic and defense ties with India to help it reduce its reliance on Russia.Since 2011, New Delhi has cut its defense imports from Russia by 53%.D.

What I do understand is that there are barriers to getting mums involved in politics and I think that damages our political debates.\" Creasy lost a battle with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority this summer after she was told she could not hire a locum to cover her maternity leave after the birth of her second child.Responding to a suggestion Monday by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer that she should \"go and enjoy her maternity leave with her baby,\" Creasy tweeted: \"Without maternity cover I don\\'t actually get maternity leave as no one else to do my job.\"New Zealand speaker feeds lawmaker\\'s baby during debate in Parliament In the US, Senator Tammy Duckworth made history in 2018 as she became the first senator to cast a vote on the Senate floor with her newborn by her side, days after the Senate changed longstanding rules to allow newborns onto the Senate floor during votes for the first time.

This is the British monarch\\'s second birthday since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Born in London on April 21, 1926, Britain\\'s longest reigning sovereign usually celebrates her birthday privately, but the occasion is marked publicly with gun salutes in Hyde Park, Windsor Great Park and at the Tower of London.That particular tradition was absent from last year\\'s scaled-back occasion, as it will be Wednesday -- not just because of the pandemic, but because the Royal Family is officially in mourning until Friday.

(CNN)It\\'s not easy watching Pelé shuffling into shot for an interview, needing the aid of a walker before almost shoving it away with disdain. The disdain, however, is counterpointed by the Brazilian football great freely drumming away on a shoeshine box, or laughing with teammates over some food.These are some of the scenes from a new Pelé documentary on Netflix.Co-director David Tryhorn tells CNN Sport though Pelé has \"done tens of thousands of interviews his entire life,\" once the filmmakers explained what they wanted to do, the 80-year-old was \"very focused on his own legacy at this stage in life.\"\"You\\'re often dealing with sort of memories of memories,\" adds Tryhorn as he reflects on the issues which can arise when attempting to extract anecdotes out of a man now in his ninth decade of life. Read More\"Our challenge was to try and get behind those stock answers and try and get him to dig a little deeper in remembering things that often were happening 50, 60 or 70 years ago.\"Brazilian striker Pelé, wearing his famous Santos jersey in 1961.The film charts the rise of the legendary Brazilian forward, culminating in arguably the crowning glory of the career of \"O Rei\\' (\"The King\"): Carrying his country, both on and off the pitch, to a third World Cup triumph in Mexico 1970.As a 17-year-old he\\'d won the World Cup in Sweden in 1958 -- scoring six times, all in the knockout rounds, including twice in the final to defeat the hosts 5-2 -- and then winning the tournament again four years later in Chile, though injuries prematurely ended his involvement.The parallels with the recent ESPN series on another sportsman many would put on the Mount Rushmore of athletes -- Michael Jordan\\'s \"The Last Dance\" -- are all too evident: A global star reflecting on former glories on the big stage.But as Jordan often dealt with internal politics within the Chicago Bulls, realpolitik permeates the heart of \"Pelé,\" with Brazil under a military dictatorship by the time the 1970 World Cup takes place. READ: The billion-dollar move that Michael Jordan almost missedAlthough the filmmakers could have focused on football, Tryhorn was determined \"that an iconic figure of Pelé\\'s stature deserved a definitive documentary.\"And as the film\\'s other director Ben Nicholas notes, by being called \"The King\" at 17, thus becoming the symbol of a new country, and a catalyst for the golden years, \"to cope with that, I think he creates this Pelé character, someone who almost kind of forgoes his own identity to become Brazil essentially.\"The first part of the documentary illustrates Pelé\\'s meteoric emergence to become a teenage World Cup winner -- juxtaposed against the devastating defeat Brazil suffered on home soil to Uruguay at the climax of the 1950 tournament -- giving way to the Brazilian military taking charge in 1964 and showing interest in football as a tactical and political strategy.Brazilian army tanks in front of Laranjeiras Palace in Rio de Janeiro, 1964, as the Brazilian Armed Forces took control of the country. Pelé in ProfileFrom firsthand experience of being around him, Nicholas holds the opinion that the criticism which has come Pelé\\'s way of taking an apolitical stance at a difficult period for his country has not impacted him, with the icon remaining comfortable in his choices, or arguably non-choices. \"You\\'re seeing people who are ready to challenge the establishment come to power,\" says Nicholas. \"Pelé is very much not that.\"He\\'s someone that as a kid came from a background where to be the establishment would have been an amazing thing. He\\'s someone who doesn\\'t really want to be seen as rebellious or divisive. \"So, I think he actually is able to be quite honest because I think he\\'s always stuck to the program. \\'I\\'m \\'The King.\\' I\\'m a guy who brings joy through what I do on the pitch. \"I\\'m a guy who takes a lot of pride in representing Brazil back at home and all around the world. And that\\'s what I\\'m good at. And that\\'s what I\\'m going to stick with.\\' I don\\'t think he\\'s lying about that. I think he did what he thought was best for him. And for Brazil.\"  READ: Rio votes to put Pele\\'s name on famous Maracana stadiumThough that 1970 victory was seemingly the stuff of a Hollywood scriptwriter\\'s dreams, the nightmare-ish reality was that after being cynically fouled during the 1962 tournament, and to a more damaging extent in 1966, even if Pelé was not done with football, he was seemingly content to let the tournament continue without him --\"I\\'m not lucky in World Cups\" -- as he rather quaintly puts it.For a military dictatorship who prioritized Mexico 1970 as a \"government issue,\" this presented a problem. Carlos Alberto and Pelé celebrate an iconic goal marking the final score of 4-1 as Brazil beat Italy to win the World Cup for a third time.The solution, in large part, was wearing the iconic yellow shirt with the number 10 on the back.As Nicholas recalls, \"there\\'s a question in the air of, \\'can Pelé get it back? Can he remember who he used to be? Can he remember what he used to represent? How does he want to be remembered?\\' And I guess, what kind of country does Brazil want to be? And everyone kind of has a choice as we get to Mexico in 1970.\" When asked during the documentary if his views of the dictatorship changed over time, Pelé cryptically leaves the question hanging in the air: \"My door was always open. Everyone knows this. And that includes when things were really bad.\"SEE: Images from the \"Pele: Art, Life, Football\" exhibitionIn a fitting end to his World Cup story, Pelé deals with the pressure on all fronts by delivering a sublime level of performance throughout the competition. This reaches its apotheosis with the assist in the final to captain Carlos Alberto, who scored possibly the greatest team goal in history in the dying minutes of the 4-1 win over Italy, further romanticized by 1970 being the first World Cup broadcast in color.Nevertheless, Pelé himself experienced a vastly different emotion.\"There\\'s a really telling line at the end of the film,\" Tryhorn points out, \"where you\\'re expecting Pelé to give us perhaps a \\'Pelé-ism,\\' where he would talk about joy and happiness, but he actually talks about \\'relief.\\'\" VISIT: CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosThe late Argentinian football great Diego Maradona (L) and Pelé pose after a football match in 2016.\\'The King\\' or the GOAT?Football fans will forever debate where Pelé sits in the pantheon of all-time greats.Is he higher than, or equal to Diego Maradona? Or is he slightly lower than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo due to the modern-day game\\'s relentlessness?READ: Pele congratulates Cristiano Ronaldo for surpassing Brazilian\\'s \\'record of goals in official matches\\'His prolific amount of goals -- The Guinness Book of World Records lists 1,279 - and indisputable fact that Pelé remains the only player to win the World Cup on three occasions cannot be easily dismissed, nor is it by the documentary. In 1971, Pelé played his final game for his country, and 50 years on, the documentary shows the Brazilian moved to tears by the memories of that era.This is a man who suffered for his art, even if he did not use a brush, or a pen, but simply had a ball at his feet.',\n",

Barcelona had won two league games since Xavi\\'s arrival, but Juanmi\\'s goal late in the second half means Real Betis moves up to third in the table and Barcelona remains seventh. Controversial Der KlassikerIn the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in an eventful and controversial Der Klassiker to move four points ahead at the top of the table. Julian Brandt gave Dortmund an early lead, but his opener was quickly canceled out by Robert Lewandowski following pressure from Thomas Müller. An entertaining first half then drew to a close with Kingsley Coman giving Bayern the lead after Dortmund failed to clear the ball from the box. However, the lead was short-lived as Erling Haaland equalized at the start of the second half with a brilliant, curling shot, and soon after Dortmund had an appeal for a penalty turned down when Marco Reus was brought down by a challenge from Lucas Hernández.Then 20 minutes later, Bayern was awarded a penalty -- which Lewandowski converted -- after a handball decision against Mats Hummels. Lewandowski scored twice for Bayern Munich. \\'\\'We saw a great game, a real top game,\" said Dortmund manager Marco Rose, who was red carded after venting his anger when the decisive penalty was given against his side. \"I think that the Mats Hummels handball, where he doesn\\'t even see the ball, is a debatable penalty. It\\'s a shame that the game was decided like that. It deserved a different outcome.\"Dortmund\\'s Emre Can was also frustrated by refereeing decisions, saying: \"In the end, a penalty decides the game. That\\'s a pity because we should have had a penalty as well. In our situation, he doesn\\'t look at the scene again.

Amid the bluster and noise that often surrounds professional sport, they found that Kipchoge\\'s quiet, contemplative demeanor was unique -- the calm at the eye of the storm.\"Eliud\\'s almost like a holy man -- he has the qualities of an ascetic monk,\" says Jake Scott, director of \"Kipchoge: The Last Milestone.\" The film, releasing digitally from August 23 in the UK and from August 24 in the US, tells the story of the first sub-two-hour marathon -- a feat Kipchoge achieved in Vienna, Austria, in 2019 as part of a venture dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge.A behind-the-scenes look at the carefully engineered environment created to maximize Kipchoge\\'s performance over 26.2 miles, it\\'s also about the understated manner of the athlete himself and his long-distance training environment back home in Kenya.Read MoreKipchoge takes part in a training session near Eldoret in March 2017.\"We went down to Eldoret, which is a high-altitude training camp in Kenya, and we found a few dozen of some of the world\\'s top middle-to-long-distance athletes living like monks,\" producer Ross Plummer tells CNN Sport. \"There was no distraction, no entertainment, no family; they were running 100 miles a week and sleeping 14, 15 hours a day. \"To us, it seemed like they were training themselves to ignore pain for the last 10 kilometers of a marathon.

He set the marathon world record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin three years ago, before becoming the first man to unofficially run the distance in under two hours the year after.

And when he does speak, he says something incredibly important.\"Within his elite training group, Kipchoge is \"very much the captain amongst the other runners,\" according to Scott, and leads in an understated manner.\"Eliud is not somebody who draws attention to himself ... he doesn\\'t distinguish himself in that way. He doesn\\'t put himself above any other person,\" Scott adds.\"I think he really lives by his code of no human is limited.\"Kipchoge coined that phrase during the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, his second attempt to run an unofficial sub-two-hour marathon following Nike\\'s Breaking2 project in Monza, Italy, in 2017.Kipchoge celebrates setting a world record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon. Unlike the unpredictable conditions of most major marathons, these sub-two-hour attempts engineered the perfect conditions to produce a fast time.In Vienna, Kipchoge ran on a smooth, flat course with few corners. He had assistance from an army of pacemakers to block wind and a support car beaming green lights onto the road to provide a visual marker of the required pace of two minutes, 50 seconds per kilometer.His fluid intake was also carefully monitored, with a cyclist on hand to pass and retrieve drink bottles.\"Getting a man to the moon involved overcoming gravity. What Kipchoge is doing is taking gravity out of the equation,\" sports scientist Ross Tucker told CNN Sport ahead of the challenge. \"The variables are too contrived for this to be regarded as a pure human accomplishment.\"Another notable aspect of the challenge, and Kipchoge\\'s career more broadly, was the shoes he had on his feet. Nike\\'s carbon-fiber-plated \"super shoes\" gained prominence around 2016, and various different versions have been released since then. Following Nike\\'s success, which has been spearheaded by Kipchoge\\'s record-breaking times, other leading brands -- including Adidas, Asics, Brooks and New Balance, among others -- have come out with versions of shoes featuring a carbon fiber plate and ultralight foam.\"Is Kipchoge an outlier of immense athletic potential? Or is he a simply a very good runner who is benefiting from the immense improvements that his shoes provide? Perhaps both,\" said Tucker.

In 2019, he won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:41 -- two seconds outside Kipchoge\\'s world record. \"What he accomplished as an athlete, it\\'s rare. You barely hear about it,\" Abdirahman continues. \"He was breaking world records -- 5 kilometer, 10 kilometer -- when there were no super shoes, when there was nothing.\"Bekele was not scheduled to run in this year\\'s Olympic marathon, reportedly because of his frustrations with the Ethiopian Athletics Federation\\'s selection policy.

Two huge pigs recently made their way onto the course at Lightcliffe Golf Club in Yorkshire, disrupting play and even injuring some golfers who tried to shoo them away. They first appeared on Sunday, remembers president Philip Marshall, although he tells CNN Sport the club \"don\\'t know where they came from.\"\"One of our golfers saw these pigs on the course and tried to shoo them off and he sustained a cut on his leg and had to go to A&E for a shot,\" Marshall said. \"And they disappeared then, so we thought they\\'d gone.

READ: A golf course with a view: mountains, wildlife and you need a helicopter to reach the 19th hole\\'Obviously dangerous\\'Because members of the golf club were unable to corral the pigs themselves, it was a case of containing the damage and waiting for outside help. Marshall says he called the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and the local police. The police said coming to collect the pigs wasn\\'t their jurisdiction and the RSPCA would come and help when they could but they \"were very overstretched.\" \"What happened was I was there for most of the day until dusk, and we\\'d managed to lead them to the far corner of the course,\" Marshall explains. \"So we got them to the corner of the course and left them there. We couldn\\'t approach them, we closed the course because they\\'re obviously dangerous. \"They ended up on the Tuesday night on the side road outside the golf club.

       " 'How the West made the most dangerous version of Putin  - CNN Over the past decade, Vladimir Putin\\'s resurgent Russia has been a perpetual concern for many in the West. europe, How the West made the most dangerous version of Putin  - CNN How the West made the most dangerous version of Putin   (CNN)Over the past decade, Vladimir Putin\\'s resurgent Russia has been a perpetual concern for many in the West.These concerns are not baseless. It\\'s undeniable that Putin and the President\\'s inner circle have grown in confidence during this period. Whether it be annexing parts of another nation, backing a dictator in a foreign war or poisoning dissidents on Russian soil, Putin\\'s Kremlin seemingly no longer seeks validation from a West that has allowed Moscow\\'s belligerence to grow with little effect on his behavior. The world has been reminded of Russia\\'s confidence in recent weeks. As gas prices soar across Europe due to a reduced supply of Russian gas and Putin severs his nation\\'s loose diplomatic ties to NATO, it\\'s worth examining how gravely Western policymakers have misread Putin and ignored his willingness to use the weapons at his disposal. The Europe-wide energy crisis reveals a very powerful tool that provides Russia with leverage in its relationship with Europe: its gas reserves.It is no secret that many European countries, including Germany, are reliant on Russian supplies of natural gas. The recent shortages have hammered home not just the economic, but geopolitical risks of this dependency.Read MoreWhile Russia is meeting its existing obligations to supply European countries, analysts say it could increase exports to enable storage ahead of what could be a cold winter, thus reducing costs and calming nerves.Europe\\'s energy crunch is giving Putin the upper hand The question from the Russian perspective is, why should we? Moscow is still awaiting German regulatory approval for Nord Stream 2, a controversial pipeline that would connect Russia to Germany and supply large amounts of gas to Western Europe. \"If the German regulator hands its clearance for supplies tomorrow, supplies of 17.5 billion cubic metres will start the day after tomorrow,\" Putin told a televised forum on Thursday, blaming the recent gas crisis and high prices on the EU\\'s energy policy, Reuters reported.The pipeline is controversial because many see it as a geopolitical influence project for Moscow, a fear that wasn\\'t tempered when Russia\\'s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said earlier this month that \"early completion of the certification\" for Nord Stream 2 would help \"cool off the current situation.\"Aside from the financial and geopolitical advantages that might come from Europe\\'s reliance on Russian gas, it also helps play into a domestic political narrative that has evolved over time in Russia: The West keeps getting things wrong.The Slavyanskaya compressor station, located in Russia\\'s Leningrad region, is the starting point of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. \"The core of this narrative is that Europe and the West needs to rethink its broken policies, be they on energy, foreign intervention or nation building,\" says Oleg Ignatov, a senior analyst at Crisis Group in Russia.\"Ten years ago, this argument was more defensive, as the Kremlin wanted to protect itself from criticism from Western governments or NGOs. But now Russia can argue that Western policies failed in Libya, Syria and now Afghanistan so badly that Russia\\'s approach has actually been correct all along,\" he adds.Western failure and Russian success are, of course, relative to the priorities of each party. Putin has said that the fall of the Soviet Union was the \"greatest geopolitical tragedy\" of the 20th century.When you factor this into so much of Putin\\'s behavior over the last decade -- annexing Crimea, gaslighting the West over military action in Syria by denying Russia\\'s activity, stirring tensions between NATO and Turkey -- it becomes easy to build an image of a leader trying to restore pride to his country and only too happy to exploit opportunities provided by naïve global counterparts.Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands at the opening ceremony of the Turkstream gas pipeline project in in Istanbul, Turkey, in January 2020.\"Since the end of the Cold War, many in Putin\\'s generation have believed it was still in a political war with the West,\" says Mark Galeotti, honorary professor at University College London, currently based in Moscow.\"This became more acute after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and is why you now see a Russia more comfortable with putting troops on international borders, spreading disinformation and going after political dissidents. As far as they\\'re concerned, this is a war footing,\" Galeotti says, before adding that \"for the West, however, Russia is extremely irksome, but not actually that much of a threat.\"Some argue that Putin\\'s relatively limited threat has bred a lackluster Western policy in the face of Russian aggression. This, in turn, has meant the Russian President can carry out hostile acts with very few consequences.The logic goes something like this. Russian agents poisoning a Russian ex-spy on British soil is of course sinister and menacing. However, it poses little actual threat to the UK, but going further than placing sanctions on individuals close to Putin could be more hassle that it\\'s worth.Russia says Berlin could ease natural gas crisis by approving Nord Stream 2This, potentially, plays into Putin\\'s hands, as it allows him to spin these events as proof that he is an untouchable strongman sticking it to the West, a theme he warmed to in a speech at the annual Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday evening in which he slammed the US for the \"mess\" it created in Afghanistan.\"The West\\'s long-term failure has been treating each hostile act as an isolated incident, rather than seeing the overall pattern of a Russia that has no desire or interest in playing by its rules,\" says Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House and author of the forthcoming book \"How Russia Gets Its Way.\"This, Giles argues, is at the heart of everything happening right now.\"Russia is becoming more open and direct. When Russia exploits Europe\\'s gas crisis to force through its Nord Stream pipeline project, or cuts all remaining links with NATO, it\\'s done openly and there is no longer a pretense\\u200b that Moscow is working towards good relations with the West. It\\'s the same pattern that we see domestically within Russia -- the increased repression is now overt and accelerating, because the Kremlin no longer cares.\"Limited consequences for the West, of course, provide little comfort to those who oppose Putin inside and outside of Russia.\"Putin is an opportunist. NATO\\'s disunity is the greatest gift he can receive,\" says Riho Terras, former commander of the Estonian Defense Forces. \"German reliance on Russian gas is a problem for those of us who share a border as it undermines unity. Brexit might be good for the UK, but it raises questions of a European army which would obviously be weaker than NATO.\" Some believe that Putin\\'s greatest asset has been hysteria and overstating of the threat he poses in some part of the West, combined with limited pushback from powerful nations, including the US, for his sincere hostility.Russia responsible for Alexander Litvinenko\\'s assassination, European court rules\"Every time an opportunity appears, he will take it. It happened in Ukraine, it happened in Georgia. He only understands strong messages and if we keep showing disunity he will respond in kind. He is a streetfighter. The West is trying to figure skate around Russia, but Putin plays ice hockey,\" says Terras.Opposition figures in Russia do believe that the West can take action that could weaken Putin\\'s position.\"Personal sanctions against the people close to Putin, who are involved in corruption and human rights abuse, will go a long way towards achieving this goal,\" says Vladimir Ashurkov, an opposition politician and Executive Director of opposition leader Alexey Navalny\\'s Anti-Corruption Foundation. However, the myth that has been fed by Western confusion and inaction as to exactly who Putin is, and what he wants, has gone some way to creating a domestic colossus who can increasingly act with impunity in a way that only serves to feed the myth surrounding him in Russia.For all the Russia hysteria over the past decade, it might be that the West\\'s reluctance to really understand Putin has helped create the most dangerous version of the man that was ever possible.',\n",

They wanted to carve out melanin-free zones in parks, pools and sidewalks to avoid what some folks called \"interracial intimacy.\"Read More That battle led to \"white flight,\" a mass migration to the suburbs of whites who no longer wanted to share their public schools and sidewalks with people of color. What\\'s happening now is White Flight 2.0. Whites are standing their ground. Consciously or unconsciously, they are reasserting their belief that public spaces belong to them alone, says Kevin M. Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University. A black Yale graduate student took a nap in her dorm\\'s common room. So a white student called police \"What we see now is the same underlying dynamic -- the feeling that these public spaces cannot be shared,\" says Kruse, author of \"White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism.\" \"But rather than white flight, it\\'s fight.   \"In the generation before, whites angry that these spaces are being shared or taken over by African-Americans packed up and left. Now they\\'re digging in and fighting.\"  The 911 call may be the weapon of choice right now -- perhaps made more obvious by the use of smartphones and social media -- but some whites have used plenty of other tools to keep people of color off-balance in public spaces. \"Black codes\" passed after the Civil War mandated that blacks seek permission before traveling. \"Sundown towns\" displayed placards at the edge of town warning people of color to get off the streets after sunset. During the Jim Crow era, a black person had to step off the curb when a white person approached. Making nonwhite people hop in public to the whims and fears of white people is an American tradition, says Robin DiAngelo, author of \"White Fragility: Why It\\'s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism.\"Woman calls the police on a black representative campaigning in Oregon That behavior is meant to send a message -- both then, as well as now with the 911 calls, she says. \"That attitude is, \\'This public space is ours, not yours. And you need to be in your rightful place,\\'\" says DiAngelo, who is white. \"It is the classic, \\'Step down off of that curb, I am coming down the sidewalk and you will submit to my presence. I own this country. I own this place. Don\\'t get uppity with me.\\'\" Diagnosing this outbreak is one thing, but stopping it is another. There are no Centers for Disease Control guidelines for changing the mind of  someone who sees a black girl selling water on the street as a public safety threat.   But talking to those who have been victimized by these 911 calls -- as well as someone who was raised in a community where this behavior was normal -- may help.\\'You could hear her voice quivering\\' A first step begins with the victims of the 911 calls. We usually see them play their part on camera -- the befuddled person of color trying to figure out why they\\'re facing a police officer. These moments often become sources of grim humor. People joke about them online. Some have created hashtags like #ExistingWhileBlack and #LivingWhileBlack to try to capture them all. It\\'s easy to forget how emotionally damaging such experiences can be. Felicia Dobson, however, offers a reminder.Three black people checked out of their Airbnb rental. Then someone called the police on them Her family made national news last month when a white Subway employee called 911 on her family because, Dobson says, she thought they might rob the store.  She and her husband, Othniel, were on a family trip when they stopped for dinner at a Subway in rural Georgia with their four children, ages 8, 12, 13 and 19, and the children\\'s aunt. Dobson, a college graduate who works in a hospital as an advocate for cancer patients, says she had already been aware of the rash of 911 calls targeting black people. \"Every time I see that on the news it just brings tears to my eyes,\" she says from her home in North Carolina. Her tears turned to shock when it happened to her. She still can\\'t figure out why someone would think a husband and wife would bring their kids along for a robbery. A tape of the 911 call was released, and she listened to the employee tell the operator that \"I need somebody to come through here please, ASAP. Now.\"  \"I am still shaking and disbelieving,\" says Dobson. \"She added information to make it sound like we were loiterers, like we didn\\'t pay for our food, and we were basically casing Subway. Never said we were a family. Never said we had children with us. She was scared and you could hear her voice quivering.\"Blacks can\\'t saunter in public without a purpose David Billings can relate to that fear. It\\'s part of his family\\'s inheritance.  He grew up in the small town of McComb, Mississippi, during the Jim Crow era. He saw the panic that swept his white community as the civil rights movement reshaped public spaces.   His family and friends didn\\'t just lose their \"for whites only\" signs. They lost their ability to control how blacks could move through those spaces. After integration, the word \"public\" became a slur, writes David Billings. In his memoir, \"Deep Denial: The Persistence of White Supremacy in the United States History and Life,\" he describes the rules. \"Blacks could not walk through a white neighborhood without a purpose such as going to and from work. They could not saunter or wander through neighborhoods. They could not pause or stop to observe the architecture of a particular house.\"  After overt racism was outlawed, Billings writes, whites still found a way to control public space.  \"We closed down libraries, pools, theaters,\" he says. \"We tried to protect ourselves from having to interact with anyone other than other white people.\" Then some whites took it a step further. They built \"a private culture in defiance of government dictates,\" he writes. Whites withdrew from the \"public sphere\" across America and migrated to the suburbs to evade integration. The word \"public\" became a slur. When it was attached to words like \"housing,\"  \"transportation\" and \"schools,\" he says, it became a code word that meant poor, black and Latino. When Billings hears about the 911 calls today, he sees some of the same forces stirring again.  \"We feel unsafe if any person of color is in our surroundings and they\\'re not in a servant\\'s role,\" he says. \"It makes us feel vulnerable.\" Billings grew up in small-town Mississippi during the Jim Crow era.  That fear is mingled with something else -- what he calls \"IRS,\" an internalized racial superiority.  It\\'s a message that\\'s passed down from one white generation to another, he says, and it\\'s buried so deep that many whites are not even aware it\\'s there. IRS can lead people to do something so unkind and unfeeling that they\\'re oblivious to it, he says. Billings still remembers how his hometown church hired guards one Sunday morning to prevent blacks from attending -- and then proceeded to praise Jesus.  \"When I was growing up, segregation was so deep and enforced that it became a way of life,\" he says. \"I really didn\\'t have to think about it. It became something that we didn\\'t even notice.\"Why these encounters are happening now But it would be a mistake to think that white flight only involved a physical retreat of whites from the city to the suburbs, says Kruse, author of \"White Flight.\" They also withdrew their support -- financial, political and social -- from public spaces they could no longer control, he says.  A group of black women say a golf course called the cops on them for playing too slow He cites a little-known battle of Atlanta that didn\\'t take place during the Civil War, but during the 1950s and \\'60s.  White Atlantans staged bitter protests during that time in an attempt to avoid sharing space with blacks at public facilities like golf courses, parks and pools. Some thought blacks carried diseases that could be spread in shared pools.  One Atlantan wrote in 1959 that \"there is nothing more intimate and integrated than a black n----- sitting beside a white girl on the trolley,\" Kruse recounts.\"They believed that these public spaces, which they considered their own, had been stolen from them and given to another race,\" Kruse writes. That resentment spilled over into two bond initiatives in 1962 and 1963. The city of Atlanta was trying to raise $80 million for improvements to schools, sewers and other public works. It also wanted to build a new civic auditorium and cultural center at the city\\'s biggest public park. But the bond initiatives went down to a \"smothering defeat,\" rejected by a margin of almost 2-1 by Atlanta\\'s white community. They felt like any advance for civil rights meant an equal loss for whites, Kruse recounts.   \"They decided if we\\'re not going to use these spaces, we\\'re not going to fund them,\" Kruse says.  Some of the whites who make 911 calls on black people in public are making a different decision today, he says.  They now feel emboldened to reassert themselves because stances that would have been deemed socially unacceptable before are no longer universally condemned, he says. What the Starbucks incident tells us about implicit bias President Trump has created a new environment. And \"taking back our country\" has taken on a literal meaning for some white people calling 911, he says.  \"Taking our country back isn\\'t just about larger politics,\" Kruse says. \"It happens in small parcels. It\\'s not just taking the nation back. It\\'s about taking that space back, that park back, that pool back, of taking it back bit by bit.\"  Part of taking it back for some white people is not having to figure out why black and brown people in public make them nervous, says DiAngelo, author of \"White Fragility\" -- especially if they never admit there\\'s a racial dimension to the 911 calls. \"We don\\'t want to see because it challenges our identity as good people,\" says DiAngelo. \"And it would require change that (we) don\\'t want to engage in. There\\'s a refusal to know or see that serves us.\" Seeking out the messengers So how does anyone reach a person who refuses to know?  During the civil rights movement, the nation decided it would no longer tolerate a dual public existence for whites and people of color, Kruse says. But while a court or government can force people to take down the \"for whites only\" signs in public, it can\\'t force them to dismantle the walls they\\'ve built in their hearts.  \"If it is something that ordinary people are doing, it\\'s a lot harder to root out,\" says Kruse. \"If there isn\\'t the same sort of a major investment of national energy into this, you\\'re going to have a lot of these isolated incidents crop up across America.\"The women\\'s suffrage movement may point the way to change, says Robin DiAngelo.  White people will ultimately have to stop the spread of these 911 calls because only they have the institutional power to halt the emotions that fuel the behavior, says DiAngelo. She gives an example from 1920 to show how this could work.  \"When women were granted the right to vote, there was only one way for us to possibly get it -- and that is for men to give it to us,\" DiAngelo says. \"I could be mean to a man in a one-on-one interaction, but my group could not deny every single member of his group access to their civil rights. But men could deny every single member of my group access to civil rights. It was on men to change it because they could.\" That kind of change may start within.  That\\'s what happened to Billings, author of  \"Deep Denial.\" He says he \"packed my suitcase full of contradictions\" and left his hometown for another world: college and seminary. He became an ordained minister, got active in the civil rights movement and now leads anti-racism workshops across America. This is why everyday racial profiling is so dangerous He says he changed because he sought out the \"messengers.\"  One was an aunt who became a missionary and civil rights activist. Another was a high school English teacher who taught him to think broader than his hometown. They all introduced him to a world \"I didn\\'t even know existed,\" he says. \"Most of us have somebody who moves us in a certain direction and opens our world view,\" Billings says. \"There are always messengers where you live. We have to seek them out.\" Yet there are others like Dobson who have to live in the world they know. This is the world where any banal activity in public -- selling water, playing golf, napping -- can literally end up with someone facing the barrel of a police officer\\'s gun. Dobson knows that #EatingSubwayWhileBlack could have easily become #DyingWhileBlack.A white woman sees a black man inspecting a house and calls the cops. But there\\'s a twist to this incident \"I thank God that the police officer who came -- what if he had been another type of officer?\" Dobson says. \"We see how that goes wrong in the news. And these are my sweet innocent children, just eating a sandwich. What if that would have happened?\"  Many nonwhites have lived with Dobson\\'s question through much of this nation\\'s history. They couldn\\'t \"wander\" or \"saunter\" through public spaces. They were constantly reacting to the whims and fears of some white person. While the recent rash of 911 calls on black people may be new, some say the underlying motivation behind them is as old as \"for whites only\" signs. As long as jittery white people continue to call the police on black girls selling water on a hot day, or black men wearing socks in a pool, they are unwittingly sending the same message their ancestors did when they forced black people to step off the curb: \"I own this country. I own this space. Don\\'t get uppity with me.\" ',\n",

Seeing her slip reminds her many fans of what that pressure, however well-intentioned, can do to an international idol.  sport, US Olympian Simone Biles\\' withdrawal from the team final reminds us that she\\'s human -- and still very much the GOAT - CNN Simone Biles\\' withdrawal reminds us that she\\'s human -- and still very much the GOAT  (CNN)Simone Biles came to the Tokyo Olympics looking to earn another gold medal or four and deliver yet another stellar performance before potentially retiring. But then she did something her fans had never seen before: She faltered. She was attempting an advanced vault move known as the Amanar, which she\\'d executed perfectly in a previous competition. The move involves a back handspring with two-and-a-half twists in the air before landing. It\\'s a feat for the average Olympian, but when Biles nails it, she looks effortless. On Tuesday, though, Biles \"looked like she got lost\" somewhere in the air, CNN sports analyst Christine Brennan said. She nearly landed on her knees and left the field of play close to tears. Minutes later, word came that Biles would not compete with the team. \"Worst nightmare coming to pass here,\" Brennan said of Biles exiting the event. Simone Biles performs on the vault during the artistic gymnastics women\\'s final at the 2020 Summer Olympics.Her departure stunned the sports world and her many fans in the US who\\'ve seen her repeatedly make the most difficult moves in gymnastics look like standard playground stunts. Biles\\' talent and charisma has catapulted her to a pedestal so high and seemingly untouchable that any mistake is magnified, and it\\'s all the more devastating -- to Biles and to her many fans -- when she falls. Read MoreBiles isn\\'t one to hide how she feels. After her less-than-perfect performance in the preliminary round Sunday, she said she feels like she has \"the weight of the world on [her] shoulders at times.\" \"I know I brush it off and make it seem like pressure doesn\\'t affect me but damn sometimes it\\'s hard hahaha!\" she wrote on Instagram. Biles, the most decorated American gymnast, defies gravity like a superhuman, but even our near-perfect heroes are fallible. Seeing her slip reminds her many fans of what pressure, however well-intentioned, can do to an international idol. Biles is seen as superhumanBiles is the greatest gymnast of all time; watch any of her previous routines and this much is undeniable. She executes moves so complex, so far from anything her competitors are capable of, that the gymnastics judging panel has been accused of dampening her scores so she doesn\\'t obliterate the competition.Here is an athlete with virtually no rival; no one has ever done the kinds of moves she can. (Ever heard of the Yurchenko double pike? Not until Simone Biles, you didn\\'t, because she was the first to ever execute it.) Dozens of articles have said as much in the weeks leading up to her return to the Olympics. She\\'s such an outsized talent that she\\'s transcended sport altogether and become the kind of cultural phenomenon that only male athletes usually got to be in a previous era.Simone Biles stumbles as she lands on the vault during the artistic gymnastics women\\'s final at the 2020 Summer Olympics.For all the praise heaped on her, she\\'s generally seemed able to acknowledge it, owning her preternatural prowess without letting the expectations weigh her down. Gone are the days of the Fierce Five, the nickname for the 2012 US Women\\'s Gymnastics stars that included Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman. It\\'s all about the 24-year-old, 4-foot-8 powerhouse with the bedazzled goat embroidered onto her leotards. Black women athletes are still being scrutinized ahead of the Olympics despite their successes But Biles returned to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with something more to prove. She was expected to become the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic honors in half a century. These are also her first Games since former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar was convicted of sexually abusing young gymnasts, including Biles and Raisman. And she\\'s doing it all without her family as they watch from half a world away.Biles is so near-perfect that even one missed step is newsworthy. At the qualifying event, she went out of bounds multiple times, docking her score (which was still the highest of the day, given the difficulty of her routine). She knew the mistake would make headlines, so she addressed the situation with candor online. Those comments -- the ones about the \"weight of the world\" on her shoulders -- made headlines, too. The spotlight is stuck on herBiles can\\'t escape attention even when she\\'s off the mat. One fellow member of Team USA shared a swooning TikTok when he saw her from afar. Her celebrity dwarfs that of the other women gymnasts she\\'s competing alongside. She\\'s the most visible face of the Olympics this year.Biles is competing in an age where so much of her life is available for public consumption, with or without her consent. Like fellow Olympian Naomi Osaka, whose own surprising loss occurred hours before Biles\\' withdrawal, Biles has spoken about the mental toll competing at the highest level has taken on her, and how she is ready to retire.\"There\\'s never been a moment in the history of athletics where we know so much about the athletes,\" said Cheryl Thompson, an assistant professor at Ryerson University who studies celebrity culture. Fans of Biles know she lived in foster care until she and her sister were adopted by her grandparents. They know that earlier this year her brother was acquitted of murder charges. And they know that she was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Nassar and the other leaders of USA Gymanstics who didn\\'t stop it. Simone Biles applauds during the artistic gymnastics women\\'s team final during the 2020 Olympic Games.Biles is the only survivor of Nassar\\'s abuse who\\'s competing in Tokyo, the New York Times reported earlier this month. She told the Times about the damage, mental and physical, the sport has taken on her body, and how she went to Tokyo not for USA Gymnastics, not even fully for herself, but for gymnasts of color.\"I\\'m going to go out there and represent the USA, represent World Champions Centre and represent Black and brown girls over the world,\" she told the Times. \"At the end of the day, I\\'m not representing USA Gymnastics.\"The abuse Biles experienced doesn\\'t overshadow her legacy because for many years, she didn\\'t acknowledge it even to herself. She regularly trained at Karolyi Ranch in Texas, where elite young gymnasts like Biles, Raisman and many more encountered Nassar regularly. She didn\\'t accept that she, too, had been abused until 2018. The weight of that realization spun her into depression, she said, and she\\'d spend most of her time sleeping -- \"because sleeping was better than offing [herself],\" she said in a Facebook series about her life.

When she was done, she received a standing ovation.Hide Caption 29 of 29Speaking out against abuse is an integral part of the reason she\\'s back at the Olympics, but far from the only one. She\\'s representing Black girls in gymnastics, gymnasts who want to compete in a safer environment and survivors of abuse. She\\'s representing Americans and women everywhere. She\\'s there to make them proud. And as the brightest star of the 2020 Olympics, she\\'s trying to impress the entire world, too. \"The Olympic Games itself is really just about creating heroes out of people so that we have someone or something to look up to and to inspire us,\" Thompson said. \"I think that\\'s at the core of the Olympic spirit.\"And when we see someone at the pinnacle of athletic achievement, someone we think we know because she\\'s shared so much of herself with us, fall and make a mistake, we feel some of that pain, too, Thompson said. Biles knows this, telling the \"Today\" show\\'s Hoda Kotb that she and her team hoped \"America still loves us.\" A few hours after the competition ended, Biles told reporters she felt like she \"didn\\'t do [her] job\" and let her team down. Her guilt was palpable. The 2020 Olympics are more intense than usual, but Biles\\' time isn\\'t over yetShe told reporters she withdrew not due to an injury, but to \"work on [her] mindfulness.\" She talked about how stressful the day leading up to the event was, how she was \"just shaking\" and could barely nap after her workout. She said she\\'d never felt that way ahead of a competition. \"I think we\\'re just too stressed out,\" she told reporters on Tuesday. \"We should be out here having fun but that\\'s not the case.\"The 2020 Summer Olympic Games are more intense than usual. For one, they\\'re taking place during a deadly pandemic that isn\\'t slowing. Biles\\' family isn\\'t with her to cheer her from the stands; very few fans are there at all. The Olympics, in the span of two weeks, are a microcosm of the human experience -- the euphoric highs, the extreme lows -- \"the joys of victory and the agony of defeat,\" Thompson said. The intensity is part of the draw for viewers, she said, but Biles\\' performance on Tuesday was more shocking than viewers had expected.\"The Olympic Games reflect so much of our times,\" Thompson said. \"And I think this is the perfect metaphor, perhaps, for 2021.\" Simone Biles is schooling us on how to excel despite setbacks (like the pandemic). The new tricks she\\'s unleashed since her Olympic golds help prove itThe withdrawal from the team competition is not the end of Biles\\' Tokyo legacy. Her disappointment was evident in her answers to reporters, but she knows herself well enough to notice when something\\'s off and when to take time to recover. On Wednesday, she withdrew from the individual all-around competition but may still compete in the other individual events she qualified for. On Tuesday, Biles said she would be taking it one day at a time.So few people can say they know what it feels like to be Biles, to continuously prove you\\'re the greatest at something while the world watches. But  Biles is the greatest not because she\\'s never lost, but because, now that she has, she\\'s reminded us what happens when the burden of expectations becomes too heavy for even the most celebrated among us to bear. She\\'s just a human being, after all, albeit one who can fly and flip through the air with ease and break records without breaking a sweat.
